## Is Mable NDIS Registered? Understanding Mable's Status

**Important Clarification**: Mable is NOT a traditional NDIS-registered provider - it's an online platform that connects participants with independent support workers.

### What This Means for You:

| NDIS Plan Management Type | Can You Use Mable? | Notes |
|---------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Self-Managed** | ✅ Yes | Full flexibility to use Mable |
| **Plan-Managed** | ✅ Yes | Can book independent workers on Mable |
| **Agency-Managed (NDIA)** | ❌ No | Must use registered NDIS providers only |
