Looking for a clear example of a functional capacity assessment report? You're in the right place. This guide won't just show you what a good report looks likeâ€”it will break down each section, explain why it's crucial for your NDIS plan, and give you the confidence to navigate your assessment process.

A Functional Capacity Assessment (FCA) report is one of the most important documents you can have in your NDIS journey. It provides the NDIS with a detailed picture of your functional capacity, the impact of your disability, and the supports you need to live a better life. A *good* report can be the key to unlocking the right level of funding.

## What is a Functional Capacity Assessment?

A Functional Capacity Assessment is a comprehensive evaluation conducted by an Allied Health professional (like an Occupational Therapist) to understand how your disability affects your everyday life. It looks at your strengths, challenges, and your ability to perform daily activities across various environments like your home, work, and community. The final report provides evidence-based recommendations for the NDIS.

## Why a *Good* Report Matters for Your NDIS Funding

The NDIS uses your FCA report to make informed decisions about your plan. A high-quality report clearly justifies the need for specific supports, services, and equipment.

Here's why it's so important:
- **Provides Objective Evidence:** It translates your day-to-day experiences into a format the NDIS understands and trusts.
- **Justifies Funding Requests:** It connects your needs directly to recommended supports, making it easier for the NDIS to approve funding.
- **Highlights Your Goals:** A good report aligns the recommendations with your personal goals, showing how the right support will help you achieve them.
- **Reduces Review Requests:** A clear, comprehensive report can prevent back-and-forth with the NDIS, leading to a faster, smoother planning process.

## How to Prepare for Your Functional Capacity Assessment

To get the most out of your FCA, preparation is key.
- **Keep a Diary:** For a week or two before the assessment, jot down tasks you find difficult, how long they take, and how you feel afterward.
- **Gather Documents:** Have any relevant medical reports or past therapy assessments ready for the assessor.
- **Think About Your Goals:** Be ready to talk about what you want to achieve. Do you want to join a group, learn a new skill, or make your home life easier?
- **Be Honest:** Don't put on a brave face. The assessor needs to see the real you and your real challenges to write an accurate report.

## What If You Disagree With Your Report?

If you receive your report and feel it doesn't accurately represent your needs, you have options.
1.  **Contact the Assessor:** Your first step should be to talk to the therapist who wrote the report. There may have been a misunderstanding that can be easily corrected.
