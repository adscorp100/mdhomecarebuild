Navigating the cost of aged care in Australia can feel like one of life's most stressful challenges. You want the best care for your loved one, but the complexity of the fees—from the basic daily fee to the means-tested calculations and accommodation costs—can be overwhelming.

**Helpful tools:** Use our **[Aged Care Calculator](/tools/aged-care-calculator)** to estimate residential care fees, or take the **[HCP vs NDIS Quiz](/tools/hcp-vs-ndis)** if you're not sure which program is right for you.

This guide is designed to be your single source of truth. We will walk you through every fee, show you how to get an official estimate, and answer the real-world questions that cause the most confusion.

## How to Estimate Your Aged Care Fees: The Official Calculator

Before we dive into the details, let's address the main reason you're here: calculating the cost.

The Australian Government provides an official tool to help you with this: the **My Aged Care Fee Estimator**.

*   **What it is:** An online calculator that provides an estimate of the fees and charges you might have to pay for both Home Care Packages and residential aged care.
*   **Where to find it:** [My Aged Care - Fee Estimator](https://www.myagedcare.gov.au/fee-estimator)
*   **Why use it:** While this guide will explain the components, the Fee Estimator is the best way to get a personalised calculation based on your specific financial situation.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Understanding the Fee Process

Calculating your fees is part of a broader process. Here’s the journey from assessment to receiving care.

### Step 1: The My Aged Care Assessment (ACAT)
Everything starts with an assessment from My Aged Care to determine your care needs and eligibility for government-funded services. This is not a financial assessment, but a clinical one. You can learn more at the [My Aged Care website](https://www.myagedcare.gov.au).

### Step 2: The Formal Means Assessment
This is the critical financial step. You must complete a formal income and assets assessment through Services Australia or the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA). This assessment determines what you will contribute to your care costs.

*   **Official Form:** You can find the necessary forms, like the [SA457 Residential Aged Care Calculation of your cost of care form](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/sa457), on the Services Australia website.
*   **For Home Care:** The assessment focuses primarily on your income.
*   **For Residential Care:** The assessment looks at both your income and your assets.

### Step 3: Receive Your Fee Letter
Once the assessment is complete, you'll receive a letter from Services Australia explaining the maximum fees you can be asked to pay. You will use this letter when making an agreement with your chosen aged care provider.

## Demystifying the Costs: A Breakdown of Every Fee

Understanding the different fees is the key to managing your budget. Here's what makes up the total cost.

| Fee Type | Who Pays It | What It Covers | Key Details & Official Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basic Daily Fee** | Everyone in government-funded aged care. | Day-to-day living costs like meals, cleaning, laundry, and utilities. | For residential care, it's capped at 85% of the single person's basic Age Pension. [Source](https://www.myagedcare.gov.au/aged-care-home-costs-and-fees) |
| **Means-Tested Care Fee** | People with income and assets over a certain threshold. | A contribution towards the clinical cost of your care. | This fee has annual and lifetime caps. For the latest caps, see the [Dept. of Health Schedule of Fees](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/schedule-of-fees-and-charges-for-residential-and-home-care). |
| **Accommodation Costs** | Residents who can afford to contribute to their room cost. | The cost of the room in the aged care facility. | Paid as a RAD, DAP, or combination. The government may fully or partially cover this for residents with low means. [Source](https://www.myagedcare.gov.au/understanding-aged-care-home-accommodation-costs) |

### The Means-Tested Care Fee in Detail
This is an additional contribution based on your means assessment. There are annual and lifetime caps on how much you can be asked to pay.
*   **Annual Cap:** Changes with indexation.
*   **Lifetime Cap:** As of 1 July 2024, the lifetime cap is $82,347.13. Once you reach this cap, you cannot be asked to pay any more means-tested care fees.

### Accommodation Costs: RAD vs. DAP (Residential Care Only)
This is for your room in the aged care home. If the means assessment shows you can afford it, you will negotiate the room price with the provider. You have 28 days after moving in to decide how you’ll pay.

*   **Refundable Accommodation Deposit (RAD):** A lump-sum payment, like an interest-free loan to the provider. The balance is fully refunded to you or your estate when you leave.
*   **Daily Accommodation Payment (DAP):** A daily rental-style payment. The DAP is calculated using the unpaid RAD amount and a government-set interest rate (the Maximum Permissible Interest Rate, or MPIR).
*   **Combination:** You can choose to pay part of the RAD and pay the rest as a DAP.

## Frequently Asked Questions

This is where we tackle the real-world questions and worries discovered from forums like Reddit and Whirlpool.

### Will I have to sell my home?
This is the most common fear. The answer is: **not necessarily**. Your former home is exempt from the assets test for residential care indefinitely if your spouse or a 'protected person' continues to live there. If no protected person lives there, the home is included in the assets test, but its value is capped. As of July 2025, this capped value is around $201,231.20. It is crucial to get financial advice on this.

### What happens if I can't afford the fees?
If you are having difficulty paying your fees for reasons beyond your control, you can apply for **financial hardship assistance**. The government has provisions to ensure no one is denied care because they cannot afford it. You can find out more at the [My Aged Care financial hardship assistance page](https://www.myagedcare.gov.au/financial-hardship-assistance).

### Is the My Aged Care Fee Estimator accurate?
The estimator is a very good guide, but it is **only an estimate**. The final amount is determined by the formal means assessment from Services Australia and the specific room price you agree on with your provider.

### What are the biggest mistakes people make?
The biggest mistake is not getting the means assessment done *before* starting to look for aged care. Not knowing your exact costs makes it impossible to choose a suitable facility. The second biggest mistake is not seeking independent financial advice from an expert in aged care.

### How does my pension get affected?
The Age Pension is included in the income assessment. How your aged care fees affect your pension depends on your individual financial situation, including whether you pay for your accommodation as a lump-sum RAD or a daily DAP, as this changes your asset and income profile.
