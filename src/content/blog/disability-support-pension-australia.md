The Disability Support Pension (DSP) is a crucial safety net for many Australians who are unable to work due to illness or injury. However, navigating the ins and outs of eligibility, payment rates, and ongoing requirements can feel complex.

If you've found yourself searching for answers about "**how much is the disability pension per fortnight**," "**how long does disability support pension last**," or "**how much money can I have in the bank on a disability pension Australia**," you're not alone. These are some of the most common questions people have about the DSP.

This comprehensive guide aims to cut through the confusion and provide you with clear, up-to-date information straight from the source, helping you understand the **Australian Disability Support Pension system**. Our goal is to offer a more detailed and easy-to-understand resource than ever before, giving you the confidence to find the information you need.

## What is the Disability Support Pension?

The Disability Support Pension (DSP) is a payment from the Australian Government, administered by Services Australia (Centrelink), for people who have a permanent physical, intellectual, or psychiatric condition that prevents them from working.

## How Much is the Disability Pension Per Fortnight? Understanding DSP Payment Rates in 2025

One of the most pressing questions for many is the actual amount they will receive. The DSP payment rate is not a single fixed figure; it depends on your individual circumstances, including your relationship status (single or partnered) and your age.

**Important Note:** Centrelink payment rates are subject to change, typically in March and September each year. The figures provided here are based on the most recent publicly available information. For the absolutely latest and most accurate figures, it is always best to check the official Services Australia website or use their payment estimator tools.

**Current DSP Rates (After September 20, 2025 Indexation):**

| Recipient Type | Maximum Fortnightly Payment |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| **Single, 21 or over** | Up to $1,149.00 |
| **Single, under 21 with dependent child** | Up to $1,149.00 |
| **Single, under 21 without dependent child** | Varies by living situation |
| **Partnered, 21 or over** | Up to $866.80 each |
| **Couple combined** | Up to $1,733.60 |

*Rates include base pension, pension supplement, and energy supplement. Your actual payment may be lower based on income and asset tests.*

## Is the Disability Support Pension Means Tested?

Yes, the Disability Support Pension is subject to both an **income test** and an **asset test**. This means that any income you earn and the value of assets you own can affect how much DSP you receive.

## The DSP Income Test: How Much Can You Earn?

Centrelink allows you to earn a certain amount of income before your DSP payment is affected. This is known as the income free area. If your income exceeds this amount, your DSP payment will be reduced gradually. For every dollar you earn over the income free area, your pension reduces by a certain amount.

- **For singles**, there is an income free area per fortnight.
- **For couples**, there is a combined income free area per fortnight.

Understanding how the income test applies to your specific situation is crucial. This includes income from employment, investments, and other sources.

### How Much Can My Partner Earn Before It Affects My Disability Pension Australia?

If you are partnered, your partner's income is also taken into account under the DSP income test. There is a combined income free area for couples. If your combined income exceeds this limit, your DSP payment will be reduced. The rate of reduction depends on how much over the limit your combined income is.

## The DSP Asset Test: How Much Money Can I Have in the Bank on a Disability Pension Australia?

The asset test looks at the value of assets you and your partner (if applicable) own. This includes things like money in bank accounts, investments, real estate (excluding your primary residence), vehicles, and other valuable items.

### Current Asset Limits (September 2025)

| Your Situation | Full Pension Limit | Payment Stops At |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Single, homeowner** | $314,000 | Calculated based on taper rate |
| **Single, non-homeowner** | $566,500 | Calculated based on taper rate |
| **Couple, homeowner** | $470,000 combined | Calculated based on taper rate |
| **Couple, non-homeowner** | $722,500 combined | Calculated based on taper rate |

**How the Asset Test Reduces Your Payment:**
- If your assets exceed the limit, your pension reduces by **$3 per fortnight for every $1,000 over** (single) or **$1.50 each** (couples)
- Your **principal home is exempt** from the asset test
- Up to **$8,300 vehicle value** is exempt

**What Counts as Assets:**
- Bank accounts and savings
- Shares and managed funds
- Investment properties
- Vehicles over $8,300 value
- Superannuation (if you've reached preservation age)
- Business assets

## How Long Does Disability Support Pension Last? Does Disability Pension Stop at 65?

The Disability Support Pension is designed to provide long-term support for individuals with permanent conditions that prevent them from working.

Generally, if you are granted the DSP, it continues for as long as you meet the eligibility criteria, including the medical rules and the income and asset tests.

### Does Disability Pension Stop at 65? (Common Question)

**No, the Disability Support Pension does NOT automatically stop at age 65.** This is one of the most searched questions about DSP. Here's what actually happens:

1. **About 13 weeks before** you reach Age Pension age (currently 67), Services Australia sends you a letter
2. **You can choose** to stay on DSP or transfer to Age Pension
3. If you transfer, your **payment rate usually stays the same or similar**
4. You'll **continue receiving pension-level benefits** and healthcare concessions

**Key Differences to Consider:**

| Factor | DSP | Age Pension |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| **Overseas travel** | 28 days/year before affected | 26 weeks before affected |
| **Medical reviews** | May be required (especially under 35) | No medical reviews |
| **Work limits** | Under 15 hours/week | More flexible |

The transfer is typically administrative and ensures you continue to receive appropriate support.

## Disability Support Pension Eligibility: How Do You Qualify?

Qualifying for the Disability Support Pension involves meeting strict medical and non-medical criteria.

The medical rules require you to have a permanent physical, intellectual, or psychiatric condition that is diagnosed, treated, and stabilised, and that prevents you from working for more than 30 hours per week. You will typically need to provide medical evidence from your doctors. Services Australia uses a comprehensive Impairment Tables assessment to determine the severity of your condition and its impact on your ability to work.

The non-medical rules include residency requirements and being aged 16 or over but under Age Pension age.

## Disability Support Pension Advance Payment: How Much Can You Get?

If you are receiving the Disability Support Pension, you may be eligible for an **advance payment**. This allows you to receive a portion of your future DSP payments as a lump sum. Eligibility for an advance payment depends on your circumstances, how long you have been receiving DSP, and whether you have repaid any previous advances.
