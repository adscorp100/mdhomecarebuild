## What is SIL (Supported Independent Living)?

SIL (Supported Independent Living) is NDIS funding for **help with daily tasks in a shared living arrangement**.

**SIL provides:**
- 24/7 support workers in the home
- Help with personal care, cooking, cleaning
- Medication management and health monitoring
- Community access and social activities
- Individual goal planning and skill development

**SIL is NOT accommodation** - that's funded separately through SDA (Specialist Disability Accommodation) or private rental.

**SIL is funded under Core Supports** - Daily Personal Activities (01_011_0107_1_1 and related line items).

### SIL vs Other Accommodation Options

**SIL (Supported Independent Living):**
- Shared house with 24/7 support
- High level daily support provided
- 3-5 residents typically
- NDIS funds the support (not the building)

**SDA (Specialist Disability Accommodation):**
- The physical building/accommodation
- Modified for extreme functional impairment
- Separate funding to SIL
- Can have SDA + SIL together

**Group Homes:**
- Older model (pre-NDIS)
- All-in-one accommodation + support
- Less choice and control
- Being phased out

**Independent Living with Support:**
- Your own home/apartment
- Support workers visit
- More independence, less intensive support
