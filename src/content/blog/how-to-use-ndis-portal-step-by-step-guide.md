## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I check my NDIS portal?
It's recommended to check your portal at least weekly to monitor budget usage, review provider communications, and stay updated on plan status. More frequent checking may be beneficial if you're actively using multiple services or approaching budget limits. During plan implementation or review periods, daily checking can help ensure everything progresses smoothly.

### What should I do if my budget shows discrepancies?
Budget discrepancies can occur due to processing delays, committed but unspent funds, or system errors. First, allow 24-48 hours for recent transactions to update. Check whether displayed amounts include committed funds from service agreements. Download detailed statements to reconcile spending against your records. If discrepancies persist, contact your plan manager (if plan-managed) or the NDIA directly for investigation.

### Can I use the portal to change my plan or add new supports?
The portal primarily displays current plan information rather than allowing direct plan modifications. You cannot add new support categories or increase funding through the portal. However, you can request plan reviews, submit reassessment requests, and provide evidence of changed circumstances. Major plan changes require formal review processes with NDIA planners.

### How do I know if a provider I found through the portal is right for me?
The portal provides basic provider information, but thorough research involves multiple steps. Review provider profiles, registration status, and any available ratings. Contact providers directly to discuss your specific needs, ask about their experience with your disability type, and inquire about their approach to service delivery. Consider requesting references from current participants and arrange initial meetings before committing to service agreements.

### What's the difference between committed and spent funds in my budget?
Committed funds are amounts allocated to ongoing service agreements with providers but not yet delivered or paid. For example, if you have a monthly service agreement, the full monthly amount shows as "committed" even if services haven't been provided yet. "Spent" funds represent money actually paid out for completed services. Understanding this distinction helps prevent budget overspend and ensures accurate planning.

### Can family members or carers access my portal on my behalf?
Portal access requires individual myGov accounts and cannot be shared. However, if you have a nominee arrangement or legal guardianship in place, those individuals may be able to access your portal through their own authorized accounts. For informal support, you can share information from your portal with family members, but they cannot log in directly using your credentials for security reasons.
