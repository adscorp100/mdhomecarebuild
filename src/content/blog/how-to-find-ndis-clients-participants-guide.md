## Understanding the NDIS Client Landscape in 2025

Before diving into strategies, it's important to understand how NDIS participants find their support workers and providers:

| How Participants Find Support | Percentage |
|------------------------------|------------|
| Online platforms (Mable, Hireup, etc.) | 35% |
| Support Coordinator referrals | 25% |
| Word of mouth | 20% |
| Google/online search | 12% |
| Community organisations | 8% |

*Source: Industry estimates based on participant surveys and platform data*

The NDIS operates on a **choice and control** model, meaning participants choose their own providers. This is great news for independent support workers and smaller providers—you're competing on service quality, not just size.

## Method 1: Online Support Worker Platforms

Online platforms are the fastest way to connect with NDIS participants actively looking for support. Here are the major platforms you should be on:

### Mable

**What it is:** Australia's largest platform connecting support workers with NDIS participants and aged care clients.

**How it works:**
- Create a free profile showcasing your skills and experience
- Set your own hourly rates
- Participants search for workers in their area and contact you directly
- Mable takes a small service fee from bookings

**Tips for success on Mable:**
- Use a professional, friendly photo (profiles with photos get 7x more enquiries)
- Write a detailed bio highlighting your experience with specific disabilities
- List all relevant qualifications and clearances
- Respond to enquiries within 2 hours when possible
- Ask satisfied clients for reviews

**Typical rates on Mable:** $35-$55/hour depending on experience and support type

### Hireup

**What it is:** A platform focused specifically on disability support, known for its user-friendly interface.

**How it works:**
- Apply to become a verified support worker
- Complete their onboarding training
- Build your profile with availability and service areas
- Get matched with participants based on preferences

**Hireup requirements:**
- NDIS Worker Screening Check
- First Aid Certificate (HLTAID011)
- Working With Children Check (if supporting under 18s)
- Proof of COVID-19 vaccination

### Other Platforms to Consider

| Platform | Best For | Fee Structure |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Like Family** | Social support, companionship | Commission-based |
| **Better Caring** | Support coordination connections | Subscription |
| **Careseekers** | Aged care crossover | Commission-based |
| **Find a Carer** | Direct participant connections | Free listings |

### Optimizing Your Platform Profile

Your profile is your first impression. Here's what makes a profile stand out:

**Must-haves:**
- ✅ Professional headshot (smiling, good lighting)
- ✅ Detailed description of your experience
- ✅ Specific disability experience mentioned
- ✅ All qualifications listed with verification
- ✅ Clear availability and service areas
- ✅ Competitive but fair pricing

**Profile bio example:**
> *"Hi, I'm Sarah! I've been supporting NDIS participants for 5 years, specialising in autism support, community access, and daily living assistance. I'm patient, reliable, and genuinely passionate about helping people achieve their goals. I have experience with non-verbal communication methods, sensory processing support, and building independence skills. I'm available weekdays in the Melbourne Eastern suburbs and love getting out into the community—whether that's going to the gym, shopping, or just grabbing a coffee."*

## Method 2: Building Relationships with Support Coordinators

Support Coordinators and Local Area Coordinators (LACs) are goldmines for client referrals. They work directly with participants to implement their plans and often need to find quality support workers.

### Why Support Coordinators Matter

- They manage multiple participants' plans
- They're constantly looking for reliable workers
- One good relationship can lead to 5-10+ client referrals
- They can vouch for your services to participants

### How to Connect with Support Coordinators

**1. Direct outreach:**
- Research Support Coordination providers in your area
- Send a professional email introducing yourself
- Offer to meet for coffee to discuss how you can help their clients
- Follow up (politely) if you don't hear back

**Email template:**
> *Subject: Experienced Support Worker Available - [Your Area]*
>
> *Hi [Name],*
>
> *I'm reaching out as an experienced NDIS support worker looking to connect with Support Coordinators in [area]. I specialise in [your specialties] and have availability for new clients.*
>
> *I'd love to briefly introduce myself and learn more about the participants you support. Would you have 15 minutes for a coffee or phone call?*
>
> *I've attached my resume and can provide references from current participants.*
>
> *Best regards,*
> *[Your name]*

**2. Networking events:**
- Attend NDIS provider forums and expos
- Join local disability sector networking groups
- Participate in NDS (National Disability Services) events

**3. Professional associations:**
- Australian Services Union (ASU)
- Health Services Union (HSU)
- Local business chambers

### Building Long-Term Relationships

Once you connect with a Support Coordinator:
- Deliver exceptional service to any referred clients
- Communicate proactively about participant progress
- Be flexible and reliable
- Send thank-you notes for referrals
- Keep them updated on your availability

## Method 3: Social Media and Online Presence

A strong online presence helps participants (and their families) find and trust you.

### Facebook Groups

Facebook groups are incredibly active in the NDIS space. Join and participate in:

- **NDIS Support Workers Australia** (general discussion)
- **NDIS Participants and Families** (understand participant perspectives)
- **[Your City] NDIS Community** (local connections)
- **Support Workers Connect** (peer networking)

**Best practices:**
- Don't spam with ads—provide genuine value
- Answer questions when you can help
- Share your expertise without being salesy
- Wait until you're established before mentioning availability

### Google Business Profile

If you're operating as a sole trader or business, set up a Google Business Profile:

1. Go to business.google.com
2. Create your profile with your service area
3. Add photos, services, and business hours
4. Ask satisfied clients for Google reviews
5. Respond to all reviews professionally

**Why it matters:** When participants Google "NDIS support worker near me," a well-optimised profile can appear in local results.

### LinkedIn

LinkedIn is underutilised in the disability sector but valuable for:
- Connecting with Support Coordinators and Plan Managers
- Showcasing your professional credentials
- Sharing industry insights
- Being found by provider organisations hiring

### Building a Simple Website

A basic website adds credibility and helps you appear in Google searches:

**What to include:**
- About you and your experience
- Services you offer
- Service areas
- Testimonials (with permission)
- Contact form
- Your qualifications and clearances

**Cost-effective options:**
- Wix or Squarespace: $15-25/month
- WordPress with hosting: $10-20/month
- Canva website builder: Free-$15/month

## Method 4: Community Networking

Some of the best client relationships come from face-to-face community connections.

### Where to Network

**Disability-specific:**
- Local disability support groups
- Autism associations and events
- Cerebral Palsy Alliance activities
- Down Syndrome Australia chapters
- Mental health peer support groups

**Community organisations:**
- Local council disability services
- Community health centres
- Neighbourhood houses
- Libraries with accessible programs
- Recreation centres

**Healthcare connections:**
- Allied health practices (OTs, physios, speech therapists)
- GP clinics in your area
- Hospital discharge planners
- Rehabilitation centres

### Making the Most of Networking

**Do:**
- Bring business cards
- Listen more than you talk
- Follow up within 48 hours
- Offer value before asking for referrals
- Be genuinely interested in the work

**Don't:**
- Be pushy or desperate
- Promise services you can't deliver
- Speak negatively about competitors
- Forget to follow up

## Method 5: Word of Mouth and Referrals

Word of mouth remains one of the most powerful ways to find clients. Happy participants tell their friends, families, and support networks.

### Encouraging Referrals

**Ask at the right time:**
- After achieving a goal together
- When a participant expresses satisfaction
- During regular review conversations

**How to ask:**
> *"I really enjoy working with you, and I'm looking to support a few more participants. If you know anyone looking for a support worker, I'd be grateful if you'd pass on my details."*

**Make it easy:**
- Provide business cards they can share
- Create a simple one-page flyer
- Offer to meet potential clients for a no-obligation chat

### Building a Referral Network

Create relationships with other support workers who can refer overflow clients:
- Workers with full schedules who get enquiries
- Workers in different geographic areas
- Workers with different specialties

**Reciprocity matters:** If someone refers to you, look for opportunities to refer back to them.

## Method 6: Registering with Provider Organisations

If you're not ready to go fully independent, registering with established NDIS providers gives you access to their client base.

### Benefits of Working with Providers

- Steady stream of clients
- Administrative support
- Training opportunities
- Less marketing effort required
- Guaranteed minimum hours (sometimes)

### Finding Providers to Work With

**Large national providers:**
- Life Without Barriers
- Endeavour Foundation
- House With No Steps
- Afford
- Aruma

**Smaller local providers** often offer:
- More flexibility
- Higher pay rates
- Closer client relationships
- Less bureaucracy

**How to apply:**
1. Check provider websites for job listings
2. Send speculative applications with your resume
3. Attend provider recruitment events
4. Network with current staff

## Method 7: Specialisation and Niche Marketing

Standing out in a crowded market often means specialising.

### High-Demand Specialisations

| Specialisation | Why It's In Demand | Additional Training |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Autism support** | Growing diagnosis rates | Autism-specific courses |
| **Complex behaviours** | Few workers trained | Restrictive practices cert |
| **SIL/SDA support** | 24/7 care needs | Group home experience |
| **Mental health** | Psychosocial stream growth | Mental health first aid |
| **High physical support** | Manual handling needs | Hoisting certification |
| **LGBTQIA+ affirming** | Community seeking safe workers | Cultural competency training |

### Building Your Specialty

1. Get additional training in your chosen area
2. Gain experience (volunteer if needed initially)
3. Update all profiles to highlight your specialty
4. Join specialty-specific networks and groups
5. Create content demonstrating your expertise

### Marketing Your Specialty

**Profile example (autism specialist):**
> *"Autism Support Specialist with 6+ years experience. I'm trained in SPELL framework, visual supports, and sensory processing strategies. I've supported participants from age 5 to 45, in home, school, and community settings. I understand that every autistic person is unique, and I pride myself on person-centred, strengths-based support."*

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to build a full client load?

Most support workers report taking 3-6 months to build a sustainable client base. This varies based on your location, specialisation, and marketing effort. Metro areas typically offer more opportunities but also more competition.

### Do I need to be a registered NDIS provider to find clients?

No. As an individual support worker, you don't need to be a registered provider. Participants can use you as an unregistered provider for most supports if their plan is self-managed or plan-managed. However, some participants with NDIA-managed plans can only use registered providers.

### How much should I charge as an NDIS support worker?

The NDIS Price Guide sets maximum rates. As of 2024-25:
- Weekday daytime: $67.56/hour (Level 2)
- Saturday: $94.86/hour
- Sunday: $122.16/hour
- Public holidays: $149.46/hour

Your actual rate will depend on how you're engaged (through a platform, provider, or direct).

### Should I specialise or be a generalist?

Both approaches work. Specialists often command higher rates and attract clients seeking specific expertise. Generalists have more flexibility and potential client pool. Consider starting broad and specialising as you discover what you enjoy and excel at.

### How do I handle participants who are difficult to work with?

Set clear boundaries from the start, communicate openly about expectations, and don't be afraid to end relationships that aren't working. Your wellbeing matters. If safety is a concern, seek support from your network or the provider organisation.
