# NDIS Social and Community Participation: Complete Guide (2026)

NDIS social and community participation funding helps you get out into the world, build relationships, and engage with your community. It's one of the most valuable parts of many NDIS plans—but it's also one of the most misunderstood.

This comprehensive guide explains exactly what NDIS social and community participation means, how the funding works in 2026, what activities are covered, 100+ specific activity examples, and how to make the most of your allocation.

## What is Increased Social and Community Participation?

"Increased Social and Community Participation" is a Capacity Building category in your NDIS plan that funds skill-building activities to help you participate more independently in your community.

Unlike Core Supports that provide ongoing assistance, Increased Social and Community Participation funding is designed to build your skills and confidence so you can eventually participate with less support—or even independently.

### ASSISTANCE vs INCREASED: The Key Difference

Understanding this distinction is crucial for using your NDIS funding correctly:

- **ASSISTANCE** (Core Support) = Someone helps you participate NOW
- **INCREASED** (Capacity Building) = Training to build skills for FUTURE independence

| Aspect | Assistance with Social & Community Participation | Increased Social & Community Participation |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Budget Category** | Core Supports | Capacity Building |
| **Purpose** | Ongoing support to participate in activities | Build skills for future independence |
| **Flexibility** | Can shift between Core categories | Must use for designated purpose |
| **Duration** | Ongoing as long as needed | Time-limited skill-building programs |
| **Example** | Support worker accompanies you to a weekly art class | 12-week program teaching you to catch public transport independently |

## Increased Social and Community Participation Line Item Codes

Here are the key line item codes for Increased Social and Community Participation (Capacity Building):

| Line Item Code | Official Name | Purpose |
|----------------|---------------|---------|
| **09_011_0117_6_3** | Development of Skills for Community Participation | Skill building for independent community access |
| **09_009_0117_6_3** | Participation in Community, Social & Civic Activities | Structured programs for social skill development |

These Capacity Building line items fund structured programs designed to increase your independence over time, such as:
- Learning to use public transport independently
- Developing social communication skills
- Training to navigate community settings
- Building confidence in new environments

## What is NDIS Social and Community Participation?

NDIS Social and Community Participation is funding that helps you:
- **Build relationships** and friendships
- **Develop social skills** and confidence
- **Access community services** and activities
- **Participate in recreational, cultural, and civic life**
- **Work towards employment** and economic independence

The funding covers support worker time to help you attend activities, navigate community settings, and develop the skills to participate more independently over time.

### The Key Distinction: Social vs Community Participation

While often grouped together, there's a subtle difference:

| Aspect | Social Participation | Community Participation |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Focus** | Building relationships, friendships, social skills | Engaging with broader community life and services |
| **Goals** | "I want to feel less isolated," "I want to make friends" | "I want to use the library independently," "I want to attend local events" |
| **Examples** | Joining clubs, attending social gatherings, meeting friends | Accessing libraries, attending civic events, using community transport |

In practice, most activities involve **both** elements—a community sports club develops social connections while engaging with community life.

## How Much Funding Can You Get?

NDIS social and community participation funding varies based on your individual needs and goals. Here's what to expect:

### Typical Funding Ranges

| Support Level | Annual Range | Typical Hours/Week |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Low support needs** | $5,000 - $10,000 | 2-4 hours |
| **Moderate support needs** | $10,000 - $20,000 | 4-6 hours |
| **High support needs** | $20,000 - $35,000+ | 6-10+ hours |

### Factors That Affect Your Funding

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Functional capacity** | Greater support needs = more hours |
| **Geographic location** | Rural/remote areas may get extra transport hours |
| **Specific goals** | Intensive skill-building programs may justify more funding |
| **Group vs individual** | Group activities stretch funding further |

### Calculating Your Needs

**Example calculation:**
- Weekly art class: 3 hours (including transport) × $67.56 = $202.68/week
- Monthly outing: 4 hours × $67.56 = $270.24/month
- Annual total: ($202.68 × 48 weeks) + ($270.24 × 12 months) = $12,981.24

Bring specific calculations like this to your planning meeting to justify your funding request.

## How to Find Local NDIS Group Activities

Finding the right activities can be challenging. Here are proven strategies:

### 1. Ask Your Support Team

Your Support Coordinator and LAC know your local area and can recommend:
- Registered providers with community programs
- Local disability organisations with groups
- Community centres with accessible activities

### 2. Use Online Resources

| Resource | What You'll Find |
|----------|------------------|
| **Clickability** | Searchable database of NDIS providers and programs |
| **NDIS Provider Finder** | Official NDIS tool for finding registered providers |
| **Meetup.com** | Local interest groups (filter by accessibility) |
| **Facebook Groups** | Search "[Your Suburb] NDIS" or "disability groups [area]" |
| **Local council websites** | Community programs, often with disability-specific options |

### 3. Check Community Resources

- **Local libraries** - Often have accessible programs and meeting spaces
- **Community centres** - Check noticeboards and websites
- **Recreation centres** - Adaptive fitness and sports programs
- **Churches and religious organisations** - Social groups and activities
- **RSL clubs** - Often have accessible social activities

### 4. Ask Other Participants

Connect with other NDIS participants through:
- Online forums (r/NDIS on Reddit)
- Local disability support groups
- Provider-organised social events

## Setting SMART Goals for Community Participation

Your NDIS plan needs clear goals to justify community participation funding. Use the SMART framework:

### SMART Goal Examples

**Goal 1: Building Social Connections**
> "I will join a local book club and attend at least 8 meetings over the next 6 months to develop friendships and improve my social confidence."

**Goal 2: Developing Skills**
> "I will complete a 12-week cooking class at the local community centre, learning to prepare 10 different meals independently."

**Goal 3: Community Engagement**
> "I will volunteer at the local animal shelter for 2 hours each week for the next 12 months, building work skills and community connections."

**Goal 4: Physical Health and Social**
> "I will join a weekly adaptive sports program, participating in at least 40 sessions over the year to improve fitness and make friends."

**Goal 5: Cultural Participation**
> "I will attend at least one community event or festival each month for the next year, expanding my cultural experiences and social network."

### What Makes a Strong Goal

| Element | Weak Example | Strong Example |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Specific** | "Get out more" | "Attend a weekly art class" |
| **Measurable** | "Meet people" | "Attend 2 social events per month" |
| **Achievable** | "Join 10 clubs" | "Join 1 club, attend consistently" |
| **Relevant** | "Learn to ski" (if not relevant to your goals) | Activity linked to your interests |
| **Time-bound** | "Eventually" | "For the next 6 months" |

## The Role of Your Support Worker

Your support worker is crucial to successful community participation. They can:

### Before the Activity
- Help you research and choose activities
- Assist with registrations and bookings
- Plan transport and logistics
- Prepare any needed equipment or communication aids

### During the Activity
- Provide physical assistance as needed
- Facilitate social interactions
- Help with communication
- Ensure your safety and comfort
- Support skill development

### After the Activity
- Help you reflect on the experience
- Identify what went well and what to improve
- Document progress towards goals
- Plan for future activities

### What Support Workers Cannot Do

| Appropriate | Not Appropriate |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Help you participate in activities | Participate on your behalf |
| Facilitate social connections | Be your only social connection |
| Support skill development | Do tasks you could do independently |
| Ensure safety | Provide medical or clinical care |

## Maximising Your Community Participation Funding

### Strategy 1: Use Group Activities

Group activities (2:1, 3:1, or 4:1 ratios) cost less per hour:

| Support Type | Rate | Your Cost (4 hrs) |
|--------------|------|-------------------|
| 1:1 Support | $67.56/hr | $270.24 |
| 2:1 Group | $38.09/hr | $152.36 |
| 3:1 Group | $27.50/hr | $110.00 |

**Savings:** A 3:1 group activity saves you ~60% compared to 1:1 support.

### Strategy 2: Combine Transport and Support

When your support worker provides transport AND activity support, you use one funding stream instead of two. Plan activities where your support worker can drive you and assist during the activity.

### Strategy 3: Build Towards Independence

The best use of community participation funding is building skills so you need less support over time:

| Stage | Support Level | Focus |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| **Initial** | High (1:1) | Learning the activity, building confidence |
| **Developing** | Moderate (2:1 group) | Practising skills, expanding network |
| **Established** | Low or none | Independent participation |

### Strategy 4: Plan Strategically

- **Cluster activities** on the same day to reduce transport time
- **Choose accessible venues** to minimise support needs
- **Build routines** so activities become easier over time
- **Start with structured programs** before independent activities

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the NDIS line item for increased social and community participation?

The main NDIS line items for Increased Social and Community Participation are:
- **09_011_0117_6_3** - Development of Skills for Community Participation
- **09_009_0117_6_3** - Participation in Community, Social & Civic Activities

These fall under the Capacity Building budget category and are designed to fund skill-building programs that help you participate more independently in your community over time.

### What is the difference between Assistance and Increased social community participation?

**Assistance with Social and Community Participation** (Core Support) provides ongoing support for you to participate in activities right now—a support worker accompanies you to help you engage in community life.

**Increased Social and Community Participation** (Capacity Building) funds structured skill-building programs designed to increase your independence over time. The goal is to develop skills so you eventually need less support.

In simple terms: Assistance = help NOW, Increased = training for FUTURE independence.

### What is the difference between social and community participation in NDIS?

Social participation focuses on building relationships and friendships, while community participation emphasises engaging with broader community services and civic life. In practice, most activities involve both elements, and they're funded under the same budget categories.

### Can I use NDIS funding for a gym membership?

The gym membership fee itself is not funded (it's an everyday cost). However, you can use funding for a support worker to assist you at the gym if it helps achieve your participation goals.

### What is the NDIS line item for community participation?

The main line items are under "Assistance with Social and Community Participation" (Core Support categories 04_104 and 04_105) and "Increased Social and Community Participation" (Capacity Building category 09).

### How much community participation funding can I get?

There's no fixed cap—it depends on your individual needs and goals. Typical ranges are $5,000-$20,000 annually, with higher amounts for participants with greater support needs.

### What are examples of increased social and community participation NDIS?

Examples of increased social and community participation NDIS funding include:
- **Skill-building activities**: 12-week cooking class to learn independent meal preparation, public transport training program
- **Social skills development**: Communication skills groups, social clubs focused on building friendships
- **Community navigation training**: Learning to access library services independently, using community facilities
- **Confidence building**: Drama classes to build self-expression, public speaking workshops

The key difference: "Increased" funding focuses on building skills for future independence, not just ongoing support.

### What is the difference between social and community participation examples?

**Social participation examples:**
- Joining a book club to make friends
- Attending a support group for people with similar disabilities
- Going to a weekly games night at a community center
- Participating in a choir or band

**Community participation examples:**
- Volunteering at a local charity or food bank
- Attending town council meetings
- Using library programs and services
- Participating in community festivals and events
- Accessing community health programs

In practice, most activities involve both social and community elements - a community sports club develops friendships (social) while engaging with broader community life (community).

### Can I use community participation funding for holidays?

Support during holiday activities can be funded if they align with your NDIS goals and help you develop participation skills. However, general holiday costs (accommodation, flights, entry fees, meals) are not funded as they're everyday expenses. The NDIS would fund the support worker hours to assist you during the holiday, but not the holiday itself.

### Do I need 1:1 support or can I join a group?

Both options are available for NDIS social and community participation:
- **Group support** (2:1, 3:1, or 4:1 ratios) is more cost-effective and provides social benefits - you'll save 40-60% on hourly rates
- **1:1 support** is appropriate when you need intensive assistance, are building initial skills, or have specific safety requirements

Many participants start with 1:1 support to build confidence, then transition to group activities as skills develop.

### What if there are no suitable activities in my area?

If you're struggling to find suitable social and community participation activities, talk to your Support Coordinator about:
- Online/virtual social groups and activities
- Transport funding to access activities in nearby suburbs
- Starting a new group with other NDIS participants
- Provider-organised community participation programs
- One-on-one community access support to explore new activities

Rural and remote participants may receive additional transport funding to access activities further away.
