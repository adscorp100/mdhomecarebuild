## NDIS Daily Living Log Template: Key Points
- Daily living logs track assistance levels across personal care, meals, mobility, household tasks, and social participation.
- Logs use a simple rating system (Independent, Prompted, Assisted, Full Support) to record the level of help provided.
- Regular logging identifies patterns, tracks progress towards goals, and provides evidence for NDIS plan reviews.
- Daily logs should be completed each day and reviewed weekly to identify any concerns or changes in support needs.
