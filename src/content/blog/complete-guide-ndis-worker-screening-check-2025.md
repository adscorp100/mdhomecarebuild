## Frequently Asked Questions

### Application Process

**How long does the NDIS Worker Screening Check take?**
Processing times vary by state but typically range from 4-8 weeks. NSW and SA tend to be faster (4-6 weeks), while VIC and NT may take longer (6-12 weeks). Peak periods around Christmas and when NDIS registration audits occur can extend processing times.

**Can I start work while my application is being processed?**
Generally, no. You must have a valid clearance before starting work in risk-assessed roles. Some states may allow supervised work in very specific circumstances, but this requires explicit approval from the screening unit and your employer.

**What if I have a criminal history?**
Having a criminal history doesn't automatically disqualify you. The screening unit conducts a comprehensive risk assessment considering factors like the nature of offenses, time elapsed, evidence of rehabilitation, and relevance to disability work. Be completely honest in your disclosure.

### Costs and Payment

**Who pays for the NDIS Worker Screening Check?**
Either the worker or the employer can pay the fee. Many employers cover the cost as part of recruitment, while independent contractors typically pay their own fees. Some states offer fee waivers for volunteers or those experiencing financial hardship.

**Can I claim the cost as a tax deduction?**
If you're an independent contractor or sole trader, the screening check fee is generally tax-deductible as a work-related expense. Employees should check with their accountant as deductibility depends on specific circumstances.

### Validity and Portability

**Is my NDIS Worker Screening Check valid in all states?**
Yes, the NDIS Worker Screening Check is nationally portable and valid across all Australian states and territories. You don't need to reapply when moving between states, but you must update your contact details with the issuing authority.

**Do I need a new check if I change employers?**
No, your clearance remains valid when changing employers. Your new employer will verify your clearance status through the NDIS Worker Screening Database using your unique identifier number.

### Renewal and Updates

**When should I renew my NDIS Worker Screening Check?**
You should apply for renewal 6 months before your current clearance expires. The clearance is valid for exactly 5 years from the issue date, and there's no grace period for expired clearances.

**What happens if I don't renew on time?**
If your clearance expires, you cannot work in risk-assessed roles until a new clearance is obtained. This requires a complete new application, not just a renewal, and full processing times apply.
