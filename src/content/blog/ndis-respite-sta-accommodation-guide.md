## NDIS STA Eligibility Requirements

### Who Qualifies for NDIS STA/Respite Services?

To get STA funding in your NDIS plan, you need to show that it is a "reasonable and necessary" support that relates to your disability.

**Eligibility Checklist:**

1. **It Helps You Meet Your Goals:** Your request for STA should align with the goals in your NDIS plan, such as building independence or increasing community participation.
2. **It Offers Value for Money:** The NDIS will consider if STA is a cost-effective way to meet your needs compared to other supports.
3. **It Supports Your Informal Network:** A primary reason for STA is to provide respite for your informal support network (family and carers) to help them sustain their caregiving role.
4. **It's Not for Holidays:** STA cannot be used solely for a holiday. While you can engage in activities, the primary purpose must be disability-related (e.g., respite or skill-building).

### Carer Eligibility Considerations:
- **Primary carer status** for the NDIS participant
- **Carer stress or burnout** requiring intervention
- **Work or health commitments** necessitating respite
- **Emergency situations** requiring immediate relief
- **Planned events** like holidays or medical appointments

### STA is a Great Option If:
- Your usual carers are unavailable or need a break from their caring role
- You want to try new things, learn new skills, or make new friends
- You are transitioning to a more independent living arrangement and want to see what it's like
- There has been a breakdown in your usual support arrangements

---

## How to Get STA in Your NDIS Plan

### Step 1: Gather Evidence
Collect reports from doctors, therapists, or support coordinators that explain why you need STA. This could include evidence of carer fatigue or the benefits of spending time in a new environment.

### Step 2: Discuss Your Goals
Clearly explain to your NDIS planner how STA will help you achieve your goals. Example goals:
- "I want to build my independence by trying a short stay away from my parents."
- "I want to give my family a break so they can continue to support me."
- "I want to make new friends by attending a weekend camp with a support worker."

### Step 3: Request a Specific Amount
While the NDIS makes the final decision, you can request a specific number of STA days based on your needs (e.g., "14 days per year to be used during school holidays").
