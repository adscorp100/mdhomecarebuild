## What is an NDIS Invoice?
An NDIS invoice is a formal document that providers use to bill for disability support services delivered to NDIS participants. Unlike standard business invoices, NDIS invoices have specific requirements set by the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) to ensure accurate processing and payment.

The invoice serves several important purposes:
- **Documentation of services delivered**: Creates a formal record of what supports were provided
- **Payment claim processing**: Enables the NDIA, plan managers, or self-managed participants to process payments
- **Audit trail**: Provides evidence of service delivery for compliance and quality audits
- **Budget tracking**: Helps participants monitor their NDIS plan spending

## Essential Elements of an NDIS Invoice
Every NDIS invoice must include specific information to be processed correctly. Missing or incorrect details can delay payment or result in claim rejections.

### Provider Information
Your invoice must clearly display:
- **Business or trading name**: Your registered business name
- **ABN (Australian Business Number)**: Required for all invoices
- **NDIS registration number**: For registered providers
- **Contact details**: Address, phone number, and email
- **Bank account details**: For payment processing

### Participant Information
Include the following participant details:
- **Full name**: As it appears on their NDIS plan
- **NDIS number**: The unique participant identifier
- **Date of birth**: For verification purposes
- **Address**: Current residential address
- **Plan manager details**: If the participant is plan-managed

### Service Details
For each service delivered, include:
- **Date of service**: When the support was provided
- **Support item number**: The specific NDIS line item code
- **Description**: Clear description of the support delivered
- **Quantity**: Hours, units, or kilometres as appropriate
- **Rate**: The charge per unit (must align with NDIS Price Guide)
- **Total amount**: Quantity multiplied by rate

### Invoice Administration
Standard administrative details:
- **Invoice number**: Unique identifier for tracking
- **Invoice date**: When the invoice was issued
- **Service period**: Start and end dates covered
- **Payment due date**: Typically 14 days from invoice date
- **Total amount due**: Sum of all services plus any applicable GST

## Understanding NDIS Support Item Numbers
Support item numbers are critical for NDIS invoicing. Each support type has a unique code that identifies the category, type, and conditions of the service.

### Support Item Number Structure
NDIS support item numbers follow a specific format. For example:
- **01_011_0107_1_1**: Assistance with Daily Life - Standard (Weekday Daytime)
- **04_104_0125_6_1**: Community Participation - Weekday Daytime
- **15_037_0117_1_3**: Provider Travel - Non-Labour Costs

The numbers indicate:
1. Support category
2. Support purpose
3. Support item
4. Claim type
5. Price control indicator

### Common Support Item Numbers for Invoicing
Here are frequently used support item numbers:

**Core Supports - Daily Activities**
| Support Item Number | Description | Unit |
|---------------------|-------------|------|
| 01_011_0107_1_1 | Assistance with Daily Life - Standard - Weekday Daytime | Hour |
| 01_011_0107_1_1_T | Assistance with Daily Life - Standard - Weekday Evening | Hour |
| 01_015_0107_1_1 | Assistance with Daily Life - High Intensity - Weekday | Hour |

**Community Participation**
| Support Item Number | Description | Unit |
|---------------------|-------------|------|
| 04_104_0125_6_1 | Community Participation - Weekday Daytime | Hour |
| 04_104_0125_6_1_T | Community Participation - Weekday Evening | Hour |
| 04_105_0125_6_1 | Community Participation - Saturday | Hour |

**Travel and Transport**
| Support Item Number | Description | Unit |
|---------------------|-------------|------|
| 15_037_0117_1_3 | Provider Travel - Non-Labour Costs | Kilometre |
| 02_051_0108_1_1 | Transport | Each |

Always verify current support item numbers against the latest NDIS Support Catalogue before invoicing.

## NDIS Invoice Requirements by Plan Management Type
The invoicing process varies depending on how a participant's NDIS plan is managed.

### NDIA-Managed (Agency-Managed) Participants
For participants whose funding is managed directly by the NDIA:
- Claims are submitted through the NDIS myplace provider portal
- Only registered providers can claim for most support types
- Invoices are processed against service bookings
- Payment typically occurs within 2-5 business days of claim approval

**Key requirements:**
- Active service booking must exist in the portal
- Support item numbers must match the service booking
- Rates cannot exceed NDIS Price Guide maximums
- Claims must be submitted within time limits

### Plan-Managed Participants
For participants using a plan manager:
- Invoices are sent to the plan manager (not the NDIA)
- Both registered and unregistered providers can invoice
- Plan managers process the claim with the NDIA
- Payment timeframes depend on the plan manager's processes

**Key requirements:**
- Include the plan manager's contact details
- Send invoices to the plan manager's preferred email
- Rates can be negotiated but typically align with Price Guide
- Include clear participant identification

### Self-Managed Participants
For participants managing their own funding:
- Invoices are sent directly to the participant
- Both registered and unregistered providers can invoice
- Participants claim reimbursement from the NDIA
- Greater flexibility in pricing and service arrangements

**Key requirements:**
- Provide detailed descriptions for participant claims
- Include all standard invoice elements
- Consider participant's preferred invoice format
- Be prepared to provide supporting documentation

## GST Requirements for NDIS Invoices
Understanding GST treatment is essential for correct NDIS invoicing.

### GST-Free NDIS Services
Most NDIS supports are GST-free under Section 38-38 of the GST Act. This includes:
- Personal care and daily living assistance
- Community participation support
- Therapy services
- Support coordination
- Most disability-related goods

### Services Attracting GST
Some items may attract GST:
- Certain transport services
- Accommodation costs
- Some equipment and consumables
- Administrative services not directly related to support

### Invoicing GST Correctly
When creating your invoice:
- Clearly indicate whether each line item is GST-free or includes GST
- If GST applies, show the GST amount separately
- Ensure your ABN is displayed (required for valid tax invoices)
- Keep records supporting GST treatment decisions

## How to Create an NDIS Invoice: Step-by-Step Guide

Before creating your invoice, collect:
- Participant's full name, NDIS number, and date of birth

### Step 2: Set Up Your Invoice Template
Use our free template or ensure your own includes:

4. Enter the quantity (hours, units, or kilometres)
5. Apply the correct rate from the NDIS Price Guide
6. Calculate the line item total

### Step 4: Calculate Totals

## Common NDIS Invoicing Mistakes to Avoid
Avoid these frequent errors that can delay payment:

### Rate Discrepancies

## Best Practices for NDIS Invoicing

### Maintain Accurate Records
Keep detailed service delivery records including:
- Daily case notes documenting supports provided
- Sign-off sheets or digital check-ins
- Progress notes linked to participant goals
- Communication records with participants and plan managers

### Invoice Promptly
- Issue invoices within 7 days of service delivery
- Set up regular invoicing schedules (weekly or fortnightly)
- Don't let invoices accumulate over long periods
- Be aware of claiming deadlines for NDIA-managed participants

### Use Clear Descriptions
- Write descriptions that anyone can understand
- Avoid jargon or abbreviations
- Link services to participant goals where relevant
- Be specific about what was delivered

### Stay Current with NDIS Changes
- Monitor NDIS Price Guide updates (usually annual)
- Check for changes to support item numbers
- Stay informed about claiming rule changes
- Attend NDIS provider training when available

## Frequently Asked Questions About NDIS Invoices

**How long do I have to submit an NDIS invoice?**
For NDIA-managed claims, you generally have 90 days from the service date to submit. For plan-managed or self-managed participants, terms vary but prompt invoicing is always recommended.

**Can I charge more than the NDIS Price Guide rate?**
For NDIA-managed and most plan-managed participants, no. Self-managed participants have more flexibility, but rates should be reasonable and agreed in advance.

**What if a participant's plan runs out of funding?**
Stop providing services and invoice only for supports delivered while funding was available. Discuss options with the participant and their plan manager or support coordinator.

**Do I need to be registered to invoice the NDIS?**
For NDIA-managed participants, registration is required for most supports. Plan-managed and self-managed participants can use both registered and unregistered providers.

**How do I correct an invoice error?**
Issue a credit note for the incorrect invoice and create a new, corrected invoice. Never alter an invoice that has already been sent.

**What records should I keep with my invoices?**
Maintain service delivery records, signed timesheets, progress notes, and any communication with participants or plan managers for at least 7 years.
