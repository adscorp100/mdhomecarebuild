> "After my fall, I was worried I wouldn't be able to stay in my own home. Keeping up with everything felt impossible. My support worker, Jenny, doesn't just clean. She helps me with my shopping, makes sure I have meals prepared for the week, and even helped me set up online bill payments. It's not just help; it's peace of mind." - *Helen P., {suburb}*

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How is this different from a standard cleaning service?**
A standard cleaning service typically performs a deep clean. Our Domestic Assistance service is a broader, ongoing support service focused on helping you manage your daily life. While it includes light housekeeping to keep your home safe and tidy, it also covers vital tasks like shopping, cooking, and laundry to support your overall independence.

**Is this service covered by my Home Care Package or NDIS plan?**
Yes. For Home Care Packages, these services are a core component. For the NDIS, they typically fall under **Core Supports - Assistance with Daily Life**. We are experts at helping you align our services with your funding.

**Can I change the tasks my support worker does each visit?**
Absolutely. Our service is designed to be flexible. You can work with your support worker to prioritise what you need done each visit, whether it's more help with meals one week or catching up on laundry the next.
