> "I was at my breaking point, completely exhausted. I called MD Home Care in the morning, and they had a wonderful carer, Sarah, at our house that same afternoon. She was so calm and professional. Just knowing my husband was in safe hands allowed me to finally get some sleep. They were an absolute lifesaver." - *Margaret L., {suburb}*
