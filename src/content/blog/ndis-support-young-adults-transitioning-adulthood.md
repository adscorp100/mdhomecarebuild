## Frequently Asked Questions

### When should we start planning for the transition to adult services?
Transition planning should ideally begin around age 14-15, with active planning starting by age 16. Early planning allows time to explore options, develop necessary skills, and establish connections with adult services. The process typically takes 2-3 years to complete effectively. Starting late can result in gaps in services or rushed decisions. Use the time to visit potential services, attend transition fairs, and gradually build independence skills. Remember that transition is a process, not an event, and requires sustained effort over several years.

### How do NDIS plans change when someone turns 18?
At 18, young people typically gain more control over their NDIS plans and decision-making. They may choose their own plan management type, select service providers, and make decisions about their supports. The planning process becomes more adult-focused, emphasizing employment, independent living, and community participation goals. Families may have less direct involvement unless there are guardianship arrangements. Some supports may change from child to adult-focused services, and new opportunities for post-secondary education and employment supports become available.

### What employment supports are available through the NDIS for young adults?
The NDIS provides comprehensive employment supports including career exploration, vocational assessment, job readiness training, and ongoing employment support. Services include finding and keeping a job supports, workplace modifications, assistive technology, and job coaching. Young adults can access supported employment services, open employment with support, or business and self-employment assistance. The focus is on building skills for mainstream employment while providing necessary accommodations and supports. Services are individualized based on career goals and support needs.

### How can families prepare for their changing role during transition?
Families can prepare by gradually shifting from protective to supportive roles, allowing increased independence and decision-making. Start conversations about the young person's goals and preferences, learn about adult services and rights, and develop comfort with supported risk-taking. Families should access transition training programs, connect with other families who have navigated transition, and consider their own support needs. Professional counseling can help with the emotional aspects of letting go while maintaining appropriate involvement and support.

### What if my young adult wants different goals than the family thinks are appropriate?
This is common during transition and reflects normal development of autonomy and self-determination. The key is finding balance between supporting the young person's choices while ensuring safety and realistic planning. Focus on understanding the young person's perspective, exploring their goals thoroughly, and identifying ways to work toward them safely. Professional support can help facilitate these conversations and develop compromise solutions. Remember that people with disabilities have the right to make choices, including the right to make mistakes and learn from them.

### How do we handle disagreements about levels of independence and support?
Disagreements about independence levels are normal during transition. Address them through open communication, professional guidance, and gradual trial experiences. Start with small steps toward independence while maintaining safety supports. Use person-centered planning approaches that focus on the young person's goals and preferences. Consider compromise solutions that allow for growth while addressing safety concerns. Professional facilitators can help navigate these discussions and develop mutually acceptable plans. Remember that building independence is a gradual process that requires patience and flexibility from everyone involved.
