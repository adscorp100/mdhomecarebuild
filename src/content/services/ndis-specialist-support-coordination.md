>
> "Before MD Home Care, we were struggling to understand my son's NDIS plan. His support network was disorganised, and we felt lost. Our Support Coordinator from MD Home Care changed everything. She listened, took control, and connected us with amazing local providers. For the first time, we feel confident about my son's future." - *Mary L., {suburb}*

Yes, MD Home Care is a registered provider for a range of NDIS supports. We manage this by ensuring our Support Coordinators act with complete independence. Their primary role is to connect you with the *best* provider for your needs, whether that's an MD Home Care service or another organisation. We offer you full choice and control, and our recommendations are always based on what's right for you, not us.

Our reputation depends on the quality of our network. We have a strict vetting process for all providers we recommend in {suburb}, ensuring they meet all NDIS quality and safety standards and have a proven track record of delivering excellent service.
