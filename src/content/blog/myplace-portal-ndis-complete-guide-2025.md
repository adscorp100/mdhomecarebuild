# myplace Portal: Complete Guide to the NDIS Participant Portal

Struggling to navigate the NDIS myplace portal? You're not alone. Many participants find the system confusing, especially when dealing with activation codes, service bookings, and payment requests. Add in the recent transition to the new "my NDIS" portal, and it's no wonder people feel overwhelmed.

This guide cuts through the confusion. We'll walk you through everything you need to know about the myplace portal, from your first login to managing your entire NDIS plan online.

## Key Points

- **The myplace portal** is the NDIS's secure online system where participants can view their plan, manage service bookings, and submit payment requests
- **Access requires a myGov account** linked to your NDIS services using a one-time activation code
- **Self-managed participants** can submit payment requests directly through the portal and receive funds within 2-3 business days
- **The portal is transitioning** to a new "my NDIS" system for participants on the PACE computer system
- **Common login issues** can usually be resolved by signing in directly through the NDIS website rather than myGov

## What is the myplace Portal?

The [myplace portal](https://www.ndis.gov.au/participants/using-your-plan/managing-your-plan/how-use-myplace-portal) is the NDIS's official online platform where participants and their representatives can access and manage NDIS information. It's hosted through the Australian Government's myGov website, making it accessible alongside other government services like Medicare, Centrelink, and the ATO.

Think of it as your NDIS control centre. Everything from viewing your plan details to paying providers happens through this single portal.

### What You Can Do in the myplace Portal

Through the myplace portal, you can:

- **View your current and previous plans** - See all the details of your NDIS plan including funding amounts and support categories
- **Check your contact details** - Ensure the NDIA has your correct information on file
- **Read messages from the NDIS** - Access all official correspondence and notifications
- **Create and view payment requests** - Submit claims for reimbursement (self-managed participants)
- **Create and manage service bookings** - Set up agreements with your service providers
- **Upload documents** - Submit assessments, service agreements, and other required paperwork
- **Share your plan with providers** - Give providers access to relevant parts of your plan
- **Find service providers** - Search for registered NDIS providers in your area

## How to Access the myplace Portal

### Step 1: Create or Use Your myGov Account

If you already have a myGov account for other government services like Medicare, the Australian Taxation Office, or Centrelink, you can use the same account to access the NDIS portal.

If you don't have a myGov account:

1. Visit [my.gov.au](https://my.gov.au)
2. Click "Create a myGov account"
3. Enter your email address and create a password
4. Verify your email address
5. Set up your security questions and phone number

### Step 2: Link Your NDIS to myGov

To [link your NDIS services to myGov](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-website/link-services-to-your-account/link-national-disability-insurance-scheme):

1. Log in to your myGov account
2. Select "Link a service" from your account dashboard
3. Search for and select "National Disability Insurance Scheme"
4. Enter your NDIS participant number and personal details
5. Request an activation code

### Step 3: Get Your Activation Code

When you link the myplace portal to your myGov account for the first time, you'll need to enter an NDIS activation code. This is a one-time 6-digit SMS code sent to the mobile phone number listed in your NDIS account.

**Important timing notes:**
- The activation code expires within **24 hours**
- Access the portal as soon as possible after receiving your code
- If you can't receive SMS for any reason, call the NDIS on **1800 800 110** (Monday - Friday, 8am - 8pm)

> **Tip:** Make sure your mobile number is up to date with the NDIS before requesting an activation code. If the number on file is wrong, you won't receive the SMS.

### Step 4: Log In to the myplace Portal

Once linked, you can access the portal in two ways:

1. **Through myGov** - Log in to myGov and select NDIS from your linked services
2. **Direct portal access** - Use the "Portal sign in" link on the top right corner of the [NDIS website home page](https://www.ndis.gov.au)

## Understanding Service Bookings

Service bookings are a critical part of how the myplace portal works. They reserve budget from your plan for services to be delivered by a provider.

### What Are Service Bookings?

A service booking is essentially a digital agreement between you and your provider that allocates funds for specific supports. Without a service booking in place, NDIA-managed providers cannot request payment for services they deliver to you.

### When Service Bookings Are Required

Service bookings are necessary when:
- You have **NDIA-managed** or **plan-managed** funding
- A provider needs to claim payment through the NDIS system
- You're setting up ongoing support arrangements with a provider

### When Service Bookings Are NOT Required

**Self-managed participants** do not need to create service bookings manually. The system automatically generates service bookings for any self-managed supports in your plan.

Instead, self-managed participants submit payment requests in the myplace portal with the receipt or invoice attached.

### How to Create a Service Booking

For NDIA-managed participants working with a registered provider:

1. Discuss and agree on services with your provider
2. The provider creates the service booking in their myplace provider portal
3. You may receive a notification to review or approve the booking
4. Once confirmed, funds are reserved from your plan budget

Service bookings can be created at the **category level** (more flexible) or **line item level** (more specific). In most cases, service bookings should be created at the category level.

## Managing Payment Requests

### For Self-Managed Participants

If you self-manage your NDIS funds, the myplace portal is where you submit payment requests to get reimbursed for supports you've purchased.

**How the process works:**

1. You receive services from a provider
2. The provider gives you an invoice or receipt
3. You log in to the myplace portal
4. Navigate to the payment request section
5. Upload the invoice/receipt and enter the details
6. Submit the payment request
7. The NDIA processes the request and pays funds to your nominated bank account within **2-3 business days**
8. You then pay your provider

### Payment Request Tips

- **Keep all receipts and invoices** - You'll need to upload them as evidence
- **Submit promptly** - Don't let invoices pile up
- **Double-check details** - Ensure amounts and support categories are correct before submitting
- **Track your submissions** - Monitor the status of payment requests in the portal

### For Plan-Managed and NDIA-Managed Participants

If your plan is managed by the NDIA or a plan manager, providers submit payment requests directly. You don't need to handle payment claims yourself, but you can still view transaction history and monitor spending in the portal.

## myplace Portal vs my NDIS Portal: What's the Difference?

In October 2023, the NDIA started rolling out a new computer system called **PACE** (Program for NDIS Administration and Customer Experience). Along with it came a [new portal called "my NDIS"](https://www.ndis.gov.au/participants/using-your-plan/managing-your-plan/my-ndis-participant-portal).

### Which Portal Should You Use?

**Use the myplace portal if:**
- Your NDIS plan is NOT in the new PACE system
- You've been using myplace and haven't been notified about a change

**Use the my NDIS portal if:**
- Your plan has been developed in the PACE system
- You've received notification that you're on the new system

### Key Differences

| Feature | myplace Portal | my NDIS Portal |
|:--------|:---------------|:---------------|
| System | Original NDIS system | New PACE system |
| Availability | All existing participants | Participants on PACE |
| Interface | Original design | More accessible, user-friendly design |
| Claim Endorsement | Basic claim viewing | Ability to check, accept or dispute provider claims (NDIA-managed) |
| Provider Endorsement | Not available | Can record "my providers" - lets NDIA know who can claim against your plan |

The NDIA is gradually transitioning all participants to the new system. If you're not sure which system you're on, continue using your current portal until you receive official notification.

## Troubleshooting Common myplace Portal Issues

### Login Problems

**Problem:** "Delay in account setup" error when trying to sign in through myGov

**Solution:** This is a [known system issue](https://www.ndis.gov.au/news/9456-system-issue-update-workaround-available-myplace-participant-portal-log-issue). The NDIA recommends:
- Sign in via the "Portal sign in" link on the NDIS website home page (top right corner) instead of through myGov
- Alternatively, use the my NDIS mobile app

**Problem:** Can't receive the SMS activation code

**Solutions:**
- Verify the mobile number on your NDIS account is correct
- Call 1800 800 110 to update your phone number or request alternative verification
- Request a new activation code if yours has expired (they only last 24 hours)

**Problem:** General login difficulties

**Solutions:**
- Make sure your internet connection is stable
- Try reloading the page
- Clear your browser's cache and cookies
- Try a different browser (Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox are most compatible)

### Provider Finder Not Working

**Problem:** Provider finder section won't open or shows errors

**Solution:** Ensure you don't have a pop-up blocker installed or enabled. The provider finder opens in a new window that may be blocked.

### Linking Multiple Children's Accounts

**Problem:** Trouble linking myGov to multiple children's NDIS accounts (as a nominee or child representative)

**Solution:** This is a common issue. Try this workaround:
1. First link one child's account
2. Once working, unlink that child
3. Link the next child
4. Unlink that child
5. Re-link the first child
6. Then link the second child

This sequence often resolves linking conflicts.

### Budget or Transaction Discrepancies

**Problem:** Portal shows incorrect budget amounts or missing transactions

**Solutions:**
- Allow 24-48 hours for recent transactions to process and update
- Check if amounts are "committed" (reserved but not yet paid) vs "spent"
- Download detailed statements for reconciliation
- Contact your plan manager (if applicable) or the NDIA on 1800 800 110

### Authentication Errors

**Problem:** "Authentication error" when accessing the portal

**Solution:** Contact the National Contact Centre on **1300 311 675** to have your authentication details reviewed and corrected.

## Using Each Person's Own NDIS Number

A common mistake that causes errors: using someone else's NDIS number when linking accounts.

Each person must link using their **own NDIS number and own myGov account**. Even if you're a nominee or child representative, you need to link using the correct participant's number associated with your authorised access.

Using another person's NDIS number (such as another child representative's, plan nominee's, or participant's) will result in an error message.

## Browser Compatibility

The myplace portal works best with:
- Microsoft Edge
- Google Chrome
- Safari
- Mozilla Firefox

If you're experiencing issues, try switching to one of these browsers. Older browsers or less common browsers may have compatibility problems with portal features.

> **Note:** Safari browser may require configuration changes to work properly. If you're having trouble with Safari, Chrome is often the simplest alternative.

## Preparing for the Portal Transition

The NDIS is progressively transitioning to new systems. Here's what you need to know:

### The PRODA to myID Transition

For providers (and relevant to participants working with providers):
- **PRODA** (Provider Digital Access) is being replaced with **myID** and **Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM)**
- Providers need to complete this transition by **10 November 2025** to maintain portal access
- This may affect how providers interact with your plan

### What This Means for You

As a participant, you'll likely:
- Continue using your current portal until notified otherwise
- Receive communication from the NDIA when your plan moves to PACE
- Need to familiarise yourself with the my NDIS portal features when transitioned

No action is required from participants until you receive official notification about your transition.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between the myplace portal and myGov?

myGov is the Australian Government's central login system that connects you to multiple government services. The myplace portal is the specific NDIS system that you access through your myGov account. Think of myGov as the front door, and myplace as one of the rooms inside.

### Can my family member or carer log in to my myplace portal for me?

If they are your registered nominee or child representative with the NDIS, they can access your portal through their own myGov account with the appropriate authorisation. However, you should never share your myGov login credentials with anyone. Each authorised person needs their own account.

### My activation code has expired. What should I do?

Request a new activation code by logging into myGov and attempting to link your NDIS services again. A fresh code will be sent to your registered mobile number. Remember, codes expire within 24 hours, so use them promptly.

### Why can't I see my payment request in the portal?

Payment requests can take 24-48 hours to appear and process. If your submission is older than this and still not showing, contact the NDIA on 1800 800 110. Make sure you received a confirmation when submitting the request.

### Do I need the myplace portal if I have a plan manager?

Yes, the portal is still valuable even with plan management. While your plan manager handles payments to providers, you can use the portal to view your plan details, track spending, access correspondence, and monitor how your budget is being used.

### How do I know if I'm on the old or new NDIS system?

If you've been transitioned to the new PACE system, you would have received notification from the NDIA. If you haven't received any notification about a change, you're likely still on the original system and should continue using the myplace portal.

### Can I access the portal on my phone?

Yes, the NDIA has a [my NDIS app](https://improvements.ndis.gov.au/participants/my-ndis-participant-portal-and-app) available for smartphones. The app provides mobile access to many portal features and can be a good alternative if you're experiencing login issues through the website.

### What should I do if the portal shows the wrong information?

First, wait 24-48 hours as updates can take time to process. If the information is still incorrect, take screenshots of the errors and contact the NDIA on 1800 800 110. Your Local Area Coordinator can also help investigate and escalate issues.
