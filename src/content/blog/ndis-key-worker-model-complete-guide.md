The NDIS key worker model is transforming how disability supports are delivered in Australia. Instead of participants juggling multiple providers with no central coordinator, a key worker becomes the single trusted professional who coordinates, delivers, and monitors all supports.

This guide explains what a key worker is, who can become one, how it differs from support coordination, and why the model is particularly valuable for early intervention and complex support needs.

## What is a Key Worker in the NDIS?

A key worker is a single professional who serves as the primary point of contact for an NDIS participant, coordinating and often delivering their supports while ensuring everything is person-centred and outcome-focused.

### Key Worker Responsibilities

| Responsibility | What It Involves |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Plan Development** | Working with the participant to develop a support plan aligned with their NDIS goals |
| **Service Coordination** | Linking participants with allied health, therapy, and community services |
| **Direct Service Delivery** | Delivering therapeutic interventions (if qualified) |
| **Progress Monitoring** | Tracking outcomes and adjusting supports as needed |
| **Family Liaison** | Being the single point of contact for families and carers |
| **Advocacy** | Representing the participant's interests with other providers and the NDIA |
| **Reporting** | Documenting progress and preparing for plan reviews |

### Where Key Workers Operate

Key workers are commonly found in:
- Early childhood intervention services
- Mental health programs
- Community-based disability services
- Private allied health practices
- NDIS-registered provider organisations

## Key Worker vs Support Coordinator: What's the Difference?

This is one of the most common questions about the key worker model. While both roles involve coordination, they serve different purposes.

| Feature | Key Worker | Support Coordinator |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Delivers AND coordinates supports | Coordinates only (no direct service delivery) |
| **Direct Service** | Yes - can provide therapy/intervention if qualified | No - refers to other providers |
| **Caseload** | Smaller (5-15 participants) for intensive work | Larger (15-30+ participants) |
| **Relationship** | Deep, ongoing therapeutic relationship | Advisory, navigational relationship |
| **Funding Source** | Core Supports or Capacity Building | Specific Support Coordination line item |
| **Typical Background** | Allied health, early childhood, nursing | Case managers, social workers |

### When to Use Each

**Choose a Key Worker when:**
- The participant needs ongoing, coordinated therapeutic input
- Multiple services need to be tightly integrated
- A single point of accountability is important
- Early intervention is the focus

**Choose Support Coordination when:**
- The participant mainly needs help navigating the system
- They need assistance finding and selecting providers
- Plan management and budgeting guidance is the priority
- Services are relatively straightforward to coordinate

> **Note:** Some participants benefit from having both—a support coordinator for plan-level navigation and a key worker for day-to-day therapeutic coordination.

## Who Can Be a Key Worker?

The key worker role isn't limited to a single profession. Various professionals can act as key workers if they meet the competency requirements.

### Eligible Professionals

| Professional | Why They Qualify |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Occupational Therapists** | Clinical expertise in daily living and therapeutic interventions |
| **Speech Pathologists** | Communication expertise, particularly valuable for children |
| **Physiotherapists** | Movement and physical function expertise |
| **Psychologists** | Behaviour support and mental health expertise |
| **Social Workers** | Strong coordination, advocacy, and case management skills |
| **Early Childhood Educators** | Developmental knowledge and family-centred practice |
| **Registered Nurses** | Clinical monitoring and health system navigation |
| **Experienced Support Workers** | With additional key worker training |

## Key Worker Qualifications and Requirements

To work as a key worker in the NDIS, you typically need:

### Mandatory Requirements

### Experience Requirements

Most employers and NDIS providers require:
- **2-3 years** minimum experience in disability support or allied health
- Demonstrated experience in early intervention (for ECEI roles)
- Evidence of person-centred practice

### Key Worker Training Programs

Several organisations offer NDIS-approved key worker training:

5. Cultural Safety and Trauma-Informed Practice

**Training renewal:** Most certifications require refresher training every 2 years.

## How the Key Worker Model Works

Here's how the key worker model operates in practice:

### Step 1: Assessment and Assignment
- Participant contacts an NDIS provider
- Provider assesses needs and assigns a key worker
- Key worker becomes the single point of contact

### Step 2: Initial Planning Meeting
- Key worker meets with participant and family
- Reviews current NDIS plan and goals
- Clarifies preferences, cultural context, and unmet needs

### Step 3: Support Plan Development
Using the NDIS Planning Toolkit, the key worker develops a plan that outlines:
- Specific outcomes to achieve
- Service mix (therapy, community access, assistive technology)
- Funding allocation across categories
- Timeline and milestones

### Step 4: Service Coordination and Delivery
- Books appointments with allied health professionals
- Coordinates schedules to avoid conflicts
- Delivers direct services if qualified
- Maintains communication with all providers

### Step 5: Progress Monitoring
- Weekly or fortnightly progress notes
- Quarterly outcome reviews
- Adjustments to support plan as needed

### Step 6: Plan Review Preparation
- Compiles evidence of outcomes achieved
- Documents budget utilisation
- Identifies any changes needed for the next plan
- Supports participant in NDIA review meetings

## Early Childhood Key Workers (ECEI)

The key worker model is particularly important in Early Childhood Early Intervention (ECEI), where coordinated, family-centred support makes the biggest difference.

### ECEI Key Worker Responsibilities

| Area | What's Involved |
|------|-----------------|
| **Developmental Support** | Coordinating therapies aligned with developmental milestones |
| **Family Education** | Teaching parents strategies to support their child at home |
| **School Transition** | Planning the move from early intervention to school |
| **Service Integration** | Ensuring therapies work together, not in silos |
| **Progress Tracking** | Monitoring developmental gains against benchmarks |

### Who Can Be an ECEI Key Worker?

ECEI key workers are typically:
- Early Childhood Teachers with disability training
- Paediatric Occupational Therapists
- Speech Pathologists with early childhood experience
- Physiotherapists specialising in paediatrics
- Allied health professionals with 2+ years in early intervention

### ECEI Key Worker Qualifications

Beyond standard key worker requirements, ECEI key workers usually need:
- Specific training in early childhood development (0-6 years)
- Understanding of the ECEI framework
- Experience with family-centred practice
- Knowledge of school transition processes

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is a key worker the same as a support coordinator?

No. A key worker delivers AND coordinates supports, while a support coordinator only helps navigate and connect to providers. Key workers have smaller caseloads and build deeper therapeutic relationships.

### Do I need a key worker if I have a support coordinator?

Not necessarily, but many participants benefit from both. The support coordinator handles plan-level navigation while the key worker manages day-to-day therapeutic coordination.

### Can any support worker become a key worker?

Experienced support workers can become key workers, but they need to complete approved key worker training and typically have 2+ years of relevant experience.

### Is the key worker model only for children?

No. While it's particularly common in early childhood intervention, the key worker model is used across all age groups, especially for participants with complex or multidisciplinary needs.

### How much does a key worker cost?

Key worker services are funded through your NDIS plan, typically under Capacity Building or Core Supports. There's no out-of-pocket cost if you have appropriate funding.

### Can I choose my own key worker?

Generally yes, though it depends on your provider. Most participants can request a different key worker if the relationship isn't working.
