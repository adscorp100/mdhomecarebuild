## What is NDIS Respite Care (Short Term Accommodation)?

Under the NDIS, respite care is officially known as **Short Term Accommodation (STA)**. It’s a support service where an NDIS participant lives away from their usual home for a short period. STA is designed to give both caregivers and participants a break from their daily routines.

Key features of STA include:
- **Duration:** Typically funded for up to 14 days at a time, with a total of 28 days per year.
- **Inclusions:** The cost covers all expenses for a 24-hour period, including accommodation, personal care, food, and activities agreed upon by the participant and the provider.
- **Purpose:** It helps caregivers rest, reduces the risk of burnout, and allows participants to try new things, make new friends, and develop new skills.

## How Much Does Respite Care Cost Per Day?

The daily cost of respite care is determined by the **staff-to-participant ratio**, the **day of the week**, and your **location**.

### 1. Staff-to-Participant Ratio

The more individual support a participant needs, the higher the cost.
-   **1:1 (One-to-One):** This is for participants who require constant, individual support.
-   **1:2, 1:3, 1:4 (Group Support):** This is more common and cost-effective, where one support worker assists multiple participants.

### 2. Day of the Week

Costs are higher on weekends and public holidays to account for increased staffing expenses.
-   **Weekdays:** Standard rates apply.
-   **Saturdays & Sundays:** Higher rates.
-   **Public Holidays:** The highest rates apply.

### 3. Location

The NDIS has different price limits for different regions.
-   **National:** Covers most of Australia.
-   **Remote & Very Remote:** These areas have higher price limits (40-50% higher) to cover the increased costs of providing services.

For a complete breakdown of NDIS pricing, see our [NDIS Price Guide](/blog/ndis-price-guide/).

## How Much Does Respite Care Cost Per Week?

A week of respite care includes five weekdays and two weekend days, which affects the total cost. Here’s an estimate of the weekly costs based on the support ratio:

-   **1:1 Support:** Approximately $15,900 per week
-   **1:2 Support:** Approximately $8,700 per week
-   **1:3 Support:** Approximately $6,300 per week
-   **1:4 Support:** Approximately $5,100 per week

These are estimates and can vary based on your specific provider and plan.

## In-Home Respite Care vs. Facility-Based Care

Respite care isn't limited to specialised facilities. It can also be provided in your own home.

-   **In-Home Respite Care:** A support worker comes to your home. This is often preferred for comfort and convenience. The cost is based on an hourly rate, which is typically around **$60-$80 per hour**, but it can be higher for high-intensity or overnight care.
-   **Facility-Based Respite Care:** This takes place at a location like a group home or aged care facility. The daily rate is all-inclusive, covering accommodation, food, and activities.

When considering 24-hour care at home, the cost is generally higher than facility-based respite due to the dedicated one-on-one support required.

## High-Intensity NDIS Respite Care

For participants with complex needs, **High-Intensity Respite Care** is available. This involves support from workers with specialised skills and training.

The cost for high-intensity care is higher, usually at a 1:1 support ratio, and can range from **$2,100 to $2,500 per day**.

## How to Get Respite Care in Your NDIS Plan

To access funding for respite care, it must be deemed "reasonable and necessary" and included in your NDIS plan. Here’s what you need to do:
1.  **Gather Evidence:** Collect reports from doctors, therapists, and other specialists that explain why respite care is needed.
2.  **Talk to Your LAC or Support Coordinator:** Discuss your need for respite care and how it aligns with your goals.
3.  **Plan Review:** If respite care isn't in your current plan, you can request a plan review to have it added.
