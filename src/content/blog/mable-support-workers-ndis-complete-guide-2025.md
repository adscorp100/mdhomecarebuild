Mable is Australia's leading online platform connecting people with disabilities to independent support workers for NDIS and private services. Unlike traditional providers, Mable is a marketplace where you negotiate rates directly with workers within the NDIS price limits.

## What is Mable Support?

Mable is an online marketplace platform that connects NDIS participants and people with disabilities to qualified support workers. The platform provides:

- **Verified support worker profiles** with qualifications and experience
- **Direct booking system** for ongoing or one-off support
- **Secure payment processing** through the platform
- **Insurance coverage** for all platform bookings
- **24/7 customer support** for participants and workers
- **Quality assurance** through ratings and reviews

Founded in 2014, Mable has become Australia's most trusted platform for finding disability support workers, processing over 500,000 hours of support monthly.

## Is Mable NDIS Registered? Understanding Mable's Status

**Important Clarification**: Mable is NOT a traditional NDIS-registered provider - it's an online platform that connects participants with independent support workers.

### What This Means for You:

| NDIS Plan Management Type | Can You Use Mable? | Notes |
|---------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Self-Managed** | ✅ Yes | Full flexibility to use Mable |
| **Plan-Managed** | ✅ Yes | Can book independent workers on Mable |
| **Agency-Managed (NDIA)** | ❌ No | Must use registered NDIS providers only |

Mable doesn't fit into provider registration categories because they don't provide support directly - they're a technology platform connecting people. The support workers on Mable are independent sole traders who may or may not be individually registered.

### Why Weekend Rates Are Higher on Mable

Support workers on Mable set their own rates, but most charge higher rates for weekends because:
- **Award entitlements**: SCHADS Award mandates penalty rates for unsociable hours

- **Market demand**: Higher demand for weekend support

**Smart tip**: If you need weekend support, book regular workers in advance - they often offer better rates for loyal clients.
