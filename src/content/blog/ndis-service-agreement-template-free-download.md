## What is an NDIS Service Agreement?

An NDIS service agreement is a legally binding contract between a registered NDIS provider and a participant that outlines the terms and conditions under which disability supports will be delivered. It is a cornerstone document that protects both parties and ensures transparency in the service relationship.

The service agreement serves several critical purposes:
- **Legal protection**: Creates a binding contract that both parties must honor
- **Clarity of expectations**: Defines exactly what services will be provided, when, and how
- **Participant empowerment**: Ensures participants understand their rights and choices
- **Compliance framework**: Demonstrates adherence to NDIS Commission requirements
- **Dispute prevention**: Provides clear processes for resolving issues before they escalate

- Plan management type (NDIA, plan-managed, self-managed)
- Contact details for participant, emergency contacts, and plan manager

- When supports will be delivered (days, times)
- Where supports will be delivered
- Any equipment or resources required
- Expected outcomes or goals

### Step 3: Set Pricing and Payment Terms
Determine:
- Unit prices for each support (check NDIS Price Guide 2026-26)
- Any applicable loadings (evening, weekend, public holiday)
- Travel fees and calculation method
- Cancellation policy and required notice period
- Payment schedule and terms
- How changes to pricing will be communicated

### Step 4: Draft the Agreement Using the Template

## Common Mistakes to Avoid in NDIS Service Agreements

### Vague Scope of Supports
- **Problem**: General descriptions like "personal care as needed"
- **Solution**: Specify exact supports, frequency, and timing

### Exceeding NDIS Price Limits
- **Problem**: Charging rates higher than the NDIS Price Guide
- **Solution**: Always check current price limits before setting rates

### Missing Participant Rights
- **Problem**: Failing to include all required rights statements
- **Solution**: Use a compliant template that includes all mandatory rights

### Unclear Termination Clauses
- **Problem**: No notice periods or termination process specified
- **Solution**: Include clear notice requirements and termination procedures

### Lack of Accessibility
- **Problem**: Agreement only provided in complex legal language
- **Solution**: Offer Easy Read versions and accessible formats

### Inadequate Dispute Resolution
- **Problem**: No clear complaints process outlined
- **Solution**: Include detailed internal process and NDIS Commission contact

### Missing Provider Obligations
- **Problem**: Agreement focuses only on participant responsibilities
- **Solution**: Clearly state all provider commitments and compliance obligations

### No Review Schedule
- **Problem**: Agreement never reviewed or updated
- **Solution**: Set specific review dates and trigger points for updates

### Unfair Contract Terms
- **Problem**: One-sided clauses that disadvantage the participant
- **Solution**: Ensure all terms are fair and comply with Australian Consumer Law

## Service Agreement Requirements by Plan Management Type

Different plan management types have specific considerations for service agreements.

### NDIA-Managed Participants
For participants whose plans are managed by the NDIA:
- Only registered providers can deliver most supports

**Key agreement elements:**

**Key agreement elements:**

### Self-Managed Participants
For participants managing their own funding:

## Frequently Asked Questions About NDIS Service Agreements

**Do I need a service agreement for every participant?**
Yes. The NDIS Commission requires all providers to have written service agreements with participants. This protects both parties and ensures clarity about service delivery.

**Can I use the same agreement template for all participants?**
You can use the same template structure, but each agreement must be customized for the individual participant's specific supports, goals, and circumstances.

**What if a participant doesn't want to sign an agreement?**
Service agreements are mandatory. If a participant is hesitant, ensure they understand the agreement protects their rights. Offer to review it together, provide an accessible version, or involve an advocate.

**How long should a service agreement be?**
Most agreements are 6-12 pages. They should be comprehensive enough to cover all requirements but not so long that they're overwhelming. Use our template as a starting point.

**Can I charge for supports not in the NDIS plan?**
Only if the participant is self-managed or plan-managed and chooses to pay privately. NDIA-managed participants can only access funded supports through the NDIS.

**What happens if the NDIS plan changes during the agreement?**
The service agreement should be reviewed and updated to reflect the new plan. Include a clause stating the agreement will be reviewed when the plan changes.

**Can I terminate an agreement immediately?**
Only in cases of serious breach, fraud, safety concerns, or Code of Conduct violations. Standard termination requires 30 days notice.

**What if a participant wants to change their services?**
Include a variation clause that allows either party to request changes with appropriate notice (typically 7-30 days depending on the change).

**Do unregistered providers need service agreements?**
Yes. While unregistered providers aren't subject to NDIS Commission registration, they should still use service agreements to protect both parties and ensure clear expectations.

**Can I include a restraint of trade clause?**
No. Participants have the right to choose any provider and change providers at any time. Clauses that restrict this right are not enforceable.
