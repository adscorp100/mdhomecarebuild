## What is Assistance with Daily Life in the NDIS?

Assistance with Daily Life is one of four Core Support categories in the NDIS. It provides funding for supports that help participants with everyday personal tasks they cannot complete independently due to their disability.

This funding covers the practical, hands-on help you need to live safely and comfortably in your home and community. Unlike Capacity Building supports that focus on building skills for the future, Assistance with Daily Life addresses your current, ongoing needs.

> **Important distinction:** Assistance with Daily Life (Core Support) is different from [Improved Daily Living](/blog/ndis-improved-daily-living-cb-daily-activity-guide/) (Capacity Building). Core supports provide ongoing assistance; Capacity Building funds therapy and training to build independence.

## How is Assistance with Daily Life Different from Improved Daily Living?

This is one of the most common points of confusion for NDIS participants. Here's the key difference:

| Feature | Assistance with Daily Life | Improved Daily Living |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Funding Type** | Core Support | Capacity Building |
| **Purpose** | Help you do tasks NOW | Build skills for FUTURE independence |
| **Examples** | Support worker helps you shower | OT teaches you to shower safely |
| **Flexibility** | Flexible within Core budget | Fixed to specific category |
| **Goal** | Maintain current lifestyle | Reduce need for support over time |

### When to Use Each Type

**Use Assistance with Daily Life when:**
- You need ongoing, regular help with personal care
- You cannot safely complete daily tasks independently
- You need someone to assist while you do activities
- The support is for maintenance, not skill-building

**Use Improved Daily Living when:**
- You want to learn new skills
- A therapist is training you or your support worker
- You're working toward greater independence
- The support includes assessment or therapy

For detailed information on Capacity Building supports, read our [NDIS Improved Daily Living Guide](/blog/ndis-improved-daily-living-cb-daily-activity-guide/).

## How to Maximise Your Daily Life Funding

### 1. Understand Your Budget Flexibility

Core Support funding is generally flexible between categories. This means you can:

- Move unused Assistance with Daily Life funds to Transport

- Reallocate funds without a formal plan amendment

> **Exception:** "Stated supports" in your plan (like SIL) are not flexible and must be used for their specific purpose.

### 2. Choose the Right Provider Type

| Provider Type | Best For | Considerations |
|---------------|----------|----------------|
| Registered Provider | NDIA-managed participants, complex care | Must follow price limits |
| Unregistered Provider | Plan-managed, self-managed | May offer lower rates |
| Individual Worker | Flexibility, continuity | Self-managed only |
| Family Member | Familiar support | Restrictions apply |

### 3. Track Your Spending

Monitor your Assistance with Daily Life budget to:

- Avoid running out before your plan ends
- Identify if you need a plan review
- Spot any incorrect provider charges
- Plan for seasonal variations in support needs

### 4. Request Plan Reviews When Needed

Request a plan review if:

- Your daily living needs increase significantly
- You're consistently running out of funding
- Your circumstances change (health, housing, support network)
- You want to add new types of daily support

## Common Questions About Assistance with Daily Life

### Can family members provide paid daily life support?

Yes, but with conditions:
- They must meet the same screening requirements as other workers
- They cannot be paid for supports they would provide anyway
- The arrangement must be approved in your plan
- Self-managed participants have more flexibility

### What's the difference between personal care and domestic assistance?

**Personal care** involves hands-on assistance with your body (showering, dressing, toileting). **Domestic assistance** involves help with household tasks (cleaning, cooking, laundry). Both fall under Assistance with Daily Life but may use different support item codes.

### Can I use this funding for meal delivery services?

Yes, meal preparation and delivery can be funded if:
- It's related to your disability needs
- It's more cost-effective than a support worker preparing meals
- It's included in your plan or covered by Core Support flexibility

### How many hours of daily support can I get?

There's no set maximum. Your funding is based on:
- Your individual functional capacity
- Your NDIS goals
- The level of support you need to live safely
- What's "reasonable and necessary" for your situation

### What if I need more support than my plan provides?

Options include:
- Request a plan review with evidence of increased need
- Use flexibility within your Core budget
- Access community or charitable services to supplement NDIS
- Speak with your Support Coordinator about alternatives
