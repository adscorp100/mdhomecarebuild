## Unlock Your Support: What Can You *Really* Spend Your Home Care Package Funds On in 2025?

Navigating the world of aged care funding can feel overwhelming, especially when you're trying to understand exactly **what you can spend your Aged Care Package on**. Whether you call it a Home Care Package (HCP), Aged Care Package, or simply '**my home care**' funding, the goal is the same: to provide you with the support you need to live safely and independently in your own home for as long as possible.

You've been approved for a package – perhaps a **Level 1 HCP**, **Level 2 HCP**, **Level 3 HCP**, or you have **HCP Level 4 funding** for higher needs – but now the big question is: **what can home care package funds be used for**? It's a common query, and getting clear answers helps you make informed decisions and get the most out of your allocated budget.

This guide breaks down the **HCP guidelines** to clarify **what can be included in a home care package**, what's generally excluded, and how to ensure your spending aligns with your assessed care needs.

## The Guiding Principle: Your Assessed Care Needs

Before diving into specifics, the most crucial rule is this: **Home Care Package funds must be used for services and items directly related to your assessed care needs, as documented in your care plan.**

The funding isn't just cash to spend freely; it's specifically targeted support identified through your ACAT (or ACAS in Victoria) assessment and further detailed in collaboration with your chosen home care provider. The aim is always to enhance your health, safety, and independence at home.

## What Can I Spend My Home Care Package Funds On? Approved Services & Items

Based on your care plan, here's a breakdown of common areas where your HCP funds can be allocated:

**Personal Care:** Assistance with daily living activities.

- Showering, bathing, dressing, grooming

### Addressing Specific Questions

**Can a home care package pay for medication?** Generally, no. The package doesn't typically cover the *cost* of the medications themselves, especially those covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). However, funds *can* be used for services related to medication, such as:

- A nurse managing your medication administration.
- A support worker reminding you to take medication.
- Transport to the pharmacy to collect prescriptions.
- Pharmacy packing services (like Webster-paks) may sometimes be covered if directly linked to a care need identified in your plan – discuss this with your provider.

**What about Home Care Package Cleaning?** Yes, domestic assistance like cleaning, laundry, and tidying is a very common and acceptable use of HCP funds if it helps you maintain a safe and healthy home environment and is included in your care plan.

## What Can Home Care Package Funds *NOT* Be Used For? Common Exclusions

Understanding exclusions is just as important:

- **Everyday Living Costs:** Rent, mortgage payments, general utility bills (electricity, gas, water, phone, internet), groceries (the food itself, distinct from meal prep services).
- **Items Covered Elsewhere:** Services or items covered by Medicare (like GP visits, specialist appointments) or the PBS (most prescription medications).
- **Travel & Accommodation:** Holidays, travel expenses not related to accessing care, accommodation costs.
- **Entertainment:** Items like streaming service subscriptions or club memberships (unless part of a specific, goal-oriented social support activity in your care plan).
- **Cash Withdrawals:** Funds cannot be withdrawn as cash.
- **Services for Others:** The package is for the assessed individual only.
- **Major Home Modifications:** Significant structural changes usually fall outside the scope of an HCP and may require other funding sources like home modification grants.

## Understanding HCP Levels and Funding

While this post focuses on *what* you can spend funds on, remember that the *amount* available depends on your assigned **HCP level**. The **HCP levels** represent different amounts of funding:

- **HCP Level 1:** Basic care needs.
- **HCP Level 2:** Low-level care needs (**Level 2 HCP funding** supports more services than Level 1. Also referred to as 'Level 2 package').
- **HCP Level 3:** Intermediate care needs.
- **HCP Level 4:** High-level care needs (**HCP Level 4 funding** provides the most substantial support).

Regardless of the level, the rules about *what* the funds can be used for remain the same – it must align with your assessed needs and care plan.

## Making the Most of Your Home Care Package

- **Review Your Care Plan Regularly:** Your needs change, and your care plan should reflect that. Discuss adjustments with your provider.
- **Communicate with Your Provider:** They are your key resource. Ask questions like "**what can I buy with my home care package**?" or "**what can be included in a home care package budget**?" They can clarify based on **HCP guidelines** and your specific situation. Consider asking about 'my home care services' availability.
- **Understand Your Budget:** Ask for clear, itemised statements showing how your funds are being spent.
- **Embrace Consumer Directed Care (CDC):** This principle gives you control over how your funds are used (within the rules). Work *with* your provider to make choices that best suit you.

## The Bottom Line

Your Home Care Package is a valuable resource designed to support your independence and wellbeing at home. Knowing **what you can spend your aged care package on** empowers you to make informed choices. Always refer back to your assessed care needs and maintain open communication with your home care provider.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I buy appliances like a fridge, washing machine, or air conditioner?
This is one of the most common questions, and the answer has important nuances.

As a general rule, Home Care Package funds **cannot** be used to pay for general household appliances or "white goods" like a standard fridge, television, or washing machine. These are considered normal living expenses that are separate from your care needs.

However, there can be **exceptions** if the item is a form of **assistive technology** essential for your health and safety due to a specific, assessed condition. The key is that the item must help manage your condition, not just improve your home.

Here's how it works in practice:
- **Standard Air Conditioner:** Unlikely to be approved if it's just for general comfort.
- **Exception:** An air conditioner or purifier *may* be approved if you have a severe respiratory condition (like COPD or severe asthma) and your doctor confirms that climate control is critical to manage your health at home.
- **Standard Fridge:** Not covered for storing food.
- **Exception:** A small, specialized fridge *may* be approved if it's solely for storing essential, temperature-sensitive medications like insulin.
- **Washing Machine:** Generally not covered.
- **Exception:** A special washing machine with features to manage severe incontinence might be considered if it's a critical part of your care plan.

**To get an appliance approved, you will almost certainly need:**
1. A formal assessment from an allied health professional (like an Occupational Therapist).
2. A letter from your GP or specialist explaining why the item is essential for your health and wellbeing.
3. To demonstrate that the appliance is a cost-effective solution compared to other options (e.g., a laundry service).

Always discuss this with your provider *before* making any purchases. They can confirm if the item meets the strict criteria based on your care plan.

### Can I use my Home Care Package to pay for home modifications?
You can use your Home Care Package for minor home modifications that enhance your safety, accessibility, and independence. These typically include installing grab rails, ramps, shower chairs, raised toilet seats, and easy-access tapware. The modifications must be directly related to your assessed care needs and documented in your care plan. However, HCP funds cannot be used for major structural changes like building extensions, full bathroom renovations, or roof repairs. There's also typically a cost threshold – modifications exceeding $1,500 usually require an occupational therapist assessment and quote comparison. For extensive modifications, you may need to explore other funding sources like the Commonwealth Home Support Programme (CHSP) or state-based home modification grants.

### Can my Home Care Package cover transport costs?
Yes, your Home Care Package can cover transport-related services that help you attend medical appointments, social activities, or essential errands like grocery shopping. This can include: (1) Support worker time to drive you using their vehicle; (2) Taxi vouchers or rideshare services for medical appointments; (3) Community transport services specifically for seniors; (4) Reimbursement for support workers using your vehicle (including fuel costs). However, the package cannot pay for vehicle registration, insurance, or maintenance of your personal vehicle, nor can it cover transport for holidays, family visits not in your care plan, or transport for people other than yourself. The transport must be directly linked to your care needs and documented in your care plan.

### Can I use my Home Care Package for massage therapy or alternative treatments?
Massage therapy and some complementary therapies may be covered by your Home Care Package if they directly address an assessed health need. For example, remedial massage might be approved for chronic pain management, especially with a referral from your GP or specialist. However, general wellness massages or treatments considered primarily for relaxation rather than addressing a specific health condition may be declined. Other alternative therapies like acupuncture, chiropractic treatment, or aromatherapy follow similar rules – they need to clearly connect to a specific health need in your care plan and may require clinical justification. The package guidelines emphasize evidence-based treatments, so your provider may ask for documentation showing the therapeutic benefit of the requested treatment for your specific condition.

### How do I pay for items under my Home Care Package?
Your provider typically arranges payment directly to service suppliers using your package funds – you don't need to pay out-of-pocket and seek reimbursement in most cases. For services like cleaning or personal care, the provider pays the worker or subcontractor directly. For equipment purchases, your provider can usually order and pay for items directly. In some cases, if you need to purchase an approved item (like specialized equipment), most providers offer a reimbursement process where you submit the receipt for repayment from your package funds. Some providers also offer a package-linked card system for small, pre-approved purchases. Always confirm your provider's specific payment processes, as these can vary. Remember that your provider must give you monthly statements showing all expenditures from your package.

### Can I pay a family member to provide care under my Home Care Package?
Generally, Home Care Package funds cannot be used to pay family members who live with you or have a close relationship with you to provide care services. This restriction helps maintain appropriate boundaries and ensures professional standards of care. However, there are some exceptions in special circumstances: (1) In remote areas where professional services are genuinely unavailable; (2) For culturally specific needs that cannot be met by available services; or (3) For unique care requirements that require specialized knowledge. In these exceptional cases, the arrangement must be formally approved as part of your care plan, properly documented, and the family member typically needs to be employed through the provider or registered as a contractor with appropriate qualifications, insurance, and ABN. Such arrangements are assessed case-by-case and require strong justification.

### What happens to unspent Home Care Package funds?
Unspent funds remain in your package account and carry forward month-to-month – they don't expire at the end of the financial year. These accumulated funds can be used for future services or one-time purchases like equipment. If you change providers, your unspent funds transfer to your new provider (minus any exit fee, capped at $500). If you leave home care altogether (e.g., moving to residential care or due to passing away), any Commonwealth contribution portion returns to the government, while your personal contribution portion is refunded to you or your estate. Regular reviews of your unspent funds are advisable – significant ongoing accumulation might indicate your care plan needs adjustment to better meet your needs. Some providers may suggest a contingency buffer of 1-2 weeks' worth of services to cover unexpected needs.

### Can I use my Home Care Package to pay for gardening services?
Yes, basic gardening services can be covered by your Home Care Package if they're necessary for your safety, accessibility, or health needs. This typically includes lawn mowing, weeding, pruning of low branches that present hazards, cleaning pathways, and maintaining garden areas you need to access. However, the package won't cover major gardening projects like landscaping, tree removal, establishing new garden beds, or purely aesthetic improvements. The gardening must be for areas you regularly use, not entire acreage properties. Most providers require garden maintenance to be performed by approved contractors (not general gardeners you've personally selected) who have appropriate insurance and work health safety compliance. The frequency and scope of gardening services should be reasonable and proportionate to your overall package budget and other care needs.
