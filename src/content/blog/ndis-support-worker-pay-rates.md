Navigating NDIS pay rates in 2025 can feel more complicated than ever. With the recent Fair Work Commission wage increase and updates to the NDIS Price Guide, it's easy to get confused about what the official rates are and how they affect a support worker's actual take-home pay.

This guide simplifies everything. We'll explain the latest changes, break down the official NDIS maximum rates, and clarify the difference between what providers can charge and what support workers earn.

## NDIS Support Worker Pay Rates Update (July 2025)

As of 1 July 2025, the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits have been updated. This includes a **3.95% increase** to the price limits for supports delivered by disability support workers, reflecting the recent minimum wage increase.

These are the **maximum rates** a provider can charge for different types of support. They are not the minimum wage a support worker receives.

| Support Item | Line Item Number | Weekday | Saturday | Sunday | Public Holiday |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard Support (Level 1)** | 04_107_0125_6_1 | **$68.06** | **$95.42** | **$122.79** | **$150.15** |
| **High Intensity Support (Level 2)** | 04_104_0125_6_1 | **$75.22** | **$105.46** | **$135.70** | **$165.95** |
| **Very High Intensity Support (Level 3)**| 04_105_0125_6_1 | **$79.56** | **$111.54** | **$143.51** | **$175.49** |
| **Night-Time Sleepover** | 04_120_0125_6_1 | **$287.13** | **$287.13** | **$287.13** | **$287.13** |

*Note: The rates above apply to TTP-registered providers. Rates may be slightly lower for non-TTP providers. These are the maximum chargeable NDIS rates, not the employee's pay rate.*

## What This Means for Support Workers (Wage vs. NDIS Price)

It is critical to understand that the NDIS Price Guide rates are **not** a support worker's hourly wage. The rates above are the maximum amount a provider can charge a participant's NDIS plan for an hour of support.

A support worker's actual pay rate is determined by their employer and must be at least the minimum set by the **Social, Community, Home Care and Disability Services (SCHADS) Award**.

Factors that influence a worker's take-home pay include:
-   Their employment contract (full-time, part-time, casual)
-   Their qualifications and experience (Level 1, 2, or 3)
-   Allowances for travel, broken shifts, and public holidays
-   The provider's own business costs (insurance, administration, superannuation)

Because of these overheads, a support worker's hourly wage will always be lower than the NDIS price limit.

## Pay Rates in Your State (QLD, VIC, NSW etc.)

We see many people searching for state-specific pay rates, like "ndis support worker pay rates qld".

It's important to know that the **NDIS Price Guide is national**. The maximum rates listed in the table above apply to all states and territories, including Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales.

While the NDIS sets the maximum price, the minimum wage is set by the SCHADS Award, which is also a national award. Therefore, you are unlikely to see significant, state-mandated differences in support worker pay.

## Frequently Asked Questions about NDIS Pay Rates

### How does the 2025 pay increase affect my wage?
The 3.95% increase applies to the *maximum rate providers can charge*. While this gives providers more room to pay their staff more, it does not automatically mean every support worker gets a 3.95% raise. Your pay is determined by your employment agreement, which must comply with the SCHADS Award. The award itself saw a 3.5% minimum wage increase from 1 July 2025.

### What is the NDIS Price Guide?
The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits (also known as the NDIS Price Guide) is a document published by the NDIA that outlines the maximum price that registered providers can charge for specific NDIS supports. It ensures NDIS participants get value for money from their plans.

### What is the TTP?
TTP stands for **Temporary Transformation Payment**. It's a conditional loading on top of the standard price limit that eligible providers can charge. It was introduced to help providers with costs associated with transitioning to the NDIS.

### What is the difference between Level 1, 2, and 3 support?
The different levels reflect the skills and experience of the support worker required to provide the support.
-   **Level 1 (Standard):** For participants who require standard support.
-   **Level 2 (High Intensity):** For participants who have more complex needs.
-   **Level 3 (Very High Intensity):** For participants with the most complex needs, requiring highly skilled and experienced workers.

### What about travel, evenings, and broken shifts?
-   **Travel:** Providers can charge for the time a worker spends travelling to a participant (up to a limit).
-   **Evenings:** There is no specific higher rate for evenings in the NDIS Price Guide, but this may be covered by a provider's own policies, which are based on the SCHADS Award.
-   **Broken Shifts:** If a support worker's shift is broken into two or more periods, they may be entitled to a broken shift allowance under the SCHADS Award.

### What is the SCHADS Award?
The **Social, Community, Home Care and Disability Services (SCHADS) Award** is the industrial award that sets the minimum pay and conditions for most workers in the disability sector. While the NDIS Price Guide sets the *maximum* a provider can charge, the SCHADS award sets the *minimum* a provider must pay their employees.
