### Why {suburb} Families Trust MD Home Care

Inviting someone into your home requires immense trust. We've built our service around earning it every day.

#### 1. A Rigorously Vetted & Insured Team
Your safety is our priority. Every support worker has passed a comprehensive National Police Check and an NDIS Worker Screening. They are our trusted employees, not contractors, and they are fully insured for your peace of mind.

#### 2. Trained for Safety, Skill, and Respect
Our staff are professionally trained in safe cleaning practices, hygiene standards, and privacy. They respect your home and your way of doing things, providing support that is helpful, not intrusive.

#### 3. Reliability is Our Promise
We know that consistency is key. We work to provide you with a regular support worker who understands your routine. We have robust systems to ensure your support worker is on time, every time. If your regular carer is sick, we arrange a suitable replacement so you are never left without support.

### Making Your Funding Simple

Navigating funding is often the biggest hurdle. We're experts in simplifying it.

*   **Home Care Packages (HCP):** Domestic assistance is a primary service available under all package levels. We help you allocate your funding and maximise your budget.
*   **NDIS Plans:** This support typically falls under **Core Supports - Assistance with Daily Life (Category 1)**. We work with you and your Plan Manager to ensure it aligns with your goals.
*   **Private Funding:** We offer flexible, transparent options for those who wish to pay privately.
