## Home Care Package Levels Overview

Home Care Packages are funded by the Australian Government to provide coordinated care services, allowing individuals to live independently. The Home Care Packages Program uses a consumer-directed care approach, ensuring services align with individual needs and goals.

There are four levels of Home Care Packages, each with increasing funding and support:

- **Level 1 Home Care Package:** Basic care needs, with an annual subsidy of $10,588.
- **Level 2 Home Care Package:** Low-level care needs, with an annual subsidy of $17,346.
- **Level 3 Home Care Package:** Intermediate care needs, with an annual subsidy of $40,529 as of January 1, 2025.
- **Level 4 Home Care Package:** High-level care needs, with an annual subsidy of $79,473.

Level 3 is designed for those requiring more frequent and comprehensive support, such as assistance with daily tasks and some nursing care.

## How Much is Level 3 Home Care Package?

The funding for Level 3 Home Care Packages is primarily through a government subsidy, with additional contributions possible from the care recipient. As of January 1, 2025, the annual government subsidy is $40,529, translating to approximately $111.04 per day. However, the total package budget can include:

- **Government Subsidy:** $40,529 annually for Level 3.
- **Care Recipient Contributions:** These may include:
    - **Basic Daily Fee:** Up to $12.75 per day as of September 20, 2024, for Level 3.
    - **Income-Tested Care Fee:** Based on income and assets, determined by Services Australia. For a detailed explanation, see our [income-tested care fee guide](/blog/income-tested-care-fee-complete-guide-australia).
    - **Additional Service Fees:** For extra services beyond the package, agreed upon with the provider.

For tips on how to best use your funds, read our [home care package spending guide](/blog/home-care-package-spending-guide).

**Real Example**: A full pensioner with a Level 3 package typically pays only the basic daily fee ($12.75), resulting in a total daily budget of $123.79 ($111.04 government subsidy + $12.75 basic fee).

This structure ensures affordability, with financial hardship assistance available for those unable to afford fees due to circumstances beyond their control.
