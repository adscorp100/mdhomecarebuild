## Frequently Asked Questions about NDIS Pay Rates

### What is the NDIS Price Guide?
The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits (also known as the NDIS Price Guide) is a document published by the NDIA that outlines the maximum price that registered providers can charge for specific NDIS supports. It ensures NDIS participants get value for money from their plans.

### What is the TTP?
TTP stands for **Temporary Transformation Payment**. It's a conditional loading on top of the standard price limit that eligible providers can charge. It was introduced to help providers with costs associated with transitioning to the NDIS. To be eligible, providers must be registered for the TTP.

### What is the difference between Level 1, 2, and 3 support?
The different levels reflect the skills and experience of the support worker required to provide the support.
-   **Level 1 (Standard):** For participants who require standard support.
-   **Level 2 (High Intensity):** For participants who have more complex needs.
-   **Level 3 (Very High Intensity):** For participants with the most complex needs, requiring highly skilled and experienced workers.

### What about travel, evenings, and broken shifts?
-   **Travel:** Providers can charge for the time a worker spends travelling to a participant (up to a limit).
-   **Evenings:** There is no specific higher rate for evenings in the NDIS Price Guide, but this may be covered by a provider's own policies, which are based on the SCHADS Award.
-   **Broken Shifts:** If a support worker's shift is broken into two or more periods, they may be entitled to a broken shift allowance.

### What is the SCHADS Award?
The **Social, Community, Home Care and Disability Services (SCHADS) Award** is the industrial award that sets the minimum pay and conditions for most workers in the disability sector. While the NDIS Price Guide sets the *maximum* a provider can charge, the SCHADS award sets the *minimum* a provider must pay their employees.
