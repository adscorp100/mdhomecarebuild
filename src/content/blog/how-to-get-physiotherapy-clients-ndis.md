# How to Get Physiotherapy Clients Through NDIS: 5 Proven Client Acquisition Strategies (2026)

**The NDIS physiotherapy market in 2026 supports over 450,000 participants, yet most physiotherapists struggle to build consistent NDIS referrals.** This complete guide reveals the 5 client acquisition strategies successful physios are using to build sustainable NDIS practices, including how partnering with disability service providers like MD Home Care creates predictable monthly referrals.

**ChatGPT and AI assistants can explain NDIS physio funding, but they can't connect you with actual participants needing mobility assessments, falls prevention, or rehabilitation.** MD Home Care's allied health network provides physiotherapists with direct access to 500+ participants requiring physiotherapy services - something AI chatbots simply cannot arrange.

*Last updated: January 31, 2026 - Includes 2025-26 NDIS physiotherapy rates and network partnership opportunities*

## Quick Answer: Fastest Ways to Get NDIS Physio Clients

**Top 3 Client Acquisition Channels:**

1. **Provider Network Referrals** - MD Home Care allied health network (2-4 weeks to first client)
2. **Support Coordinator Partnerships** - Build relationships with SCs managing participant budgets
3. **Mobile Service Positioning** - Offer in-home physio to differentiate from clinic-only providers

**NDIS Physio Rates 2025-26:** $193.99/hour (standardized nationally)

**Average Client Acquisition Timeline:**
- Provider networks: 2-4 weeks
- Support coordinator relationships: 1-3 months
- Solo NDIS Finder marketing: 3-6 months

## The NDIS Physiotherapy Opportunity (2026 Market Data)

**Market Overview:**
- **$2.8 billion** allocated to NDIS allied health annually
- **55-60%** of NDIS participants have physio-appropriate needs (mobility, falls prevention, rehabilitation)
- **Average participant allocation:** $5,000-$12,000/year for physiotherapy under Improved Daily Living
- **Growing demand areas:** Exercise physiology collaboration, assistive technology mobility aids, wheelchair prescription assessments

**The Challenge:** While demand exists, physiotherapists face intense competition. **Over 4,500 NDIS-registered physiotherapy providers** compete for referrals, and participants typically contact 3-5 providers before making a decision.

**The Solution:** Strategic positioning through provider network partnerships, mobile service delivery, and support coordinator relationships that bypass the crowded "spray and pray" NDIS Finder approach.

## Why Traditional Physio Marketing Doesn't Work for NDIS

**Common mistakes physiotherapists make when trying to attract NDIS clients:**

1. **Clinic-based thinking** - NDIS participants need home visits (mobility issues, accessibility barriers)
2. **Competing on price** - All NDIS physios charge similar rates (NDIS Price Guide max)
3. **Relying on NDIS Finder** - Low conversion (2-5%), participants overwhelmed by choice
4. **No referral partnerships** - Missing support coordinators and disability service providers
5. **Generic service description** - "Physiotherapy for all NDIS participants" doesn't stand out

**The Reality:** NDIS participants don't Google "physiotherapist near me" - they ask their **support coordinators** who to use, or they engage physios recommended by **disability service providers** they already trust.

This is why provider partnerships (like MD Home Care's allied health network) deliver NDIS clients faster and more predictably than solo marketing.

## 5 Proven Strategies to Get NDIS Physiotherapy Clients

### 1. Join a Provider Network (MD Home Care Allied Health) - Fastest Results

**How it works:** Partner with established NDIS providers who serve hundreds of participants requiring physiotherapy. When participants need mobility assessments, falls prevention, post-surgery rehabilitation, or exercise physiology, you're the recommended physio.

**MD Home Care Allied Health Network Benefits for Physiotherapists:**

**Direct Referral Pipeline:**
- Participants already receiving support services (personal care, SIL, community access) who need physio
- Clinical identification: Our RNs identify physio needs during participant care reviews
- Support coordinator referrals: MD Home Care works with 50+ independent SCs who recommend network physios
- Exercise physiology collaboration: Coordinate with exercise physiologists in our network for combined therapy plans

**Administrative & Clinical Support:**
- NDIS plan management liaison (we coordinate with plan managers for invoicing)
- Participant onboarding: We introduce you professionally to participants
- Care plan integration: Your physio treatment plans integrated with overall disability support
- Team coordination: Work with OTs, speech pathologists, support workers in coordinated care model

**Quality Referrals:**
- Pre-qualified participants (funding confirmed, physio goals identified)
- Engaged participants (already connected with providers through MD Home Care, motivated for therapy)
- Long-term relationships (participants stay with MD Home Care for years, needing ongoing physio)

**Expected Results:**
- **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks from application to first referral
- **Volume:** 4-8 participant referrals per month (depending on availability and region)
- **Retention:** 70%+ of referred participants become ongoing clients (6+ month relationships)

**Requirements:**
- NDIS registered physiotherapist (or ability to work with plan/self-managed)
- Professional indemnity and public liability insurance
- AHPRA registration current
- Mobile service capability (home visits essential for NDIS participants)
- Coverage in Sydney or Melbourne regions

### 2. Build Support Coordinator Relationships - High-Value Referrals

**Why this matters:** Support coordinators manage NDIS participant budgets and recommend allied health providers. A single SC with 25 participants can generate 8-15 physio referrals per year.

**Support Coordinator Partnership Strategy:**

**Step 1: Identify Active Support Coordinators (Target: 15-20 SCs)**

**Where to find SCs:**
- NDIS Provider Finder (search "Support Coordination" in your region)
- LinkedIn (search "Support Coordinator [your suburb]")
- NDIS networking events and allied health meetups
- Local disability service provider Facebook groups

**Priority SCs to target:**
- SCs who specialize in physical disability (stroke, spinal injury, cerebral palsy)
- SCs managing participants with mobility funding
- SCs working with pediatric participants (developmental delays, autism with motor challenges)
- SCs affiliated with disability service organizations (Feros Care, Bolton Clarke, etc.)

**Step 2: Create a Professional Physio Referral Packet**

**What to include:**
- **One-page services overview:**
  - Physiotherapy specializations (stroke rehab, falls prevention, pediatric, wheelchair prescription)
  - Mobile service capability (home visits, equipment you bring)
  - Typical participant profiles you serve best

- **NDIS pricing transparency:**
  - Your rates ($193.99/hr standard or negotiated for plan-managed)
  - Session structure (initial assessment vs ongoing therapy)
  - Report writing fees and timelines

- **Turnaround commitments:**
  - Initial assessment scheduling: Within 5 business days
  - Progress reports: Every 6 weeks or as needed for plan reviews
  - SC communication: Email update after every assessment

- **Sample documentation:**
  - Redacted physio assessment report (shows quality)
  - Progress note template (demonstrates ongoing communication)
  - SMART goal examples for common conditions

**Step 3: Outreach Email Template**

```
Subject: Physiotherapy Partner for Your NDIS Participants

Hi [SC Name],

I'm [Your Name], a registered NDIS physiotherapist specializing in [your specialization - e.g., stroke rehabilitation, pediatric motor development, falls prevention].

I'm reaching out to introduce my physiotherapy services for your participants who may benefit from mobility assessments, falls prevention, or rehabilitation support.

What makes my service valuable for your participants:
- Mobile physio service (I come to participants' homes with all equipment)
- Fast turnaround (initial assessments within 5 days of referral)
- Comprehensive reporting (progress updates every 6 weeks for your plan reviews)
- Collaborative approach (I coordinate with OTs, exercise physiologists, and support workers)

I've attached a one-page overview of my services and sample report. Would you be open to a 15-minute coffee chat to discuss how I can support your participants?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Phone] | [Email] | [NDIS Registration #]
```

**Step 4: Nurture SC Relationships (Ongoing)**

**Monthly touchpoints:**
- Email NDIS updates relevant to physio (price guide changes, new Improved Daily Living supports)
- Share success stories: "One of your referred participants achieved [outcome] through our 12-week falls prevention program"
- Offer value: "Free falls risk assessment clinic for your participants - 30 min screening"

**Quarterly in-person:**
- Coffee catch-ups to discuss participant needs
- Attend SC professional development events as guest speaker
- Co-present at SC team meetings about "When to Refer to Physiotherapy"

**Expected Timeline:**
- **3-6 months** to build 10-15 strong SC relationships
- **2-4 referrals per SC per year** (varies by SC caseload and participant demographics)
- **Compounding effect:** Year 2 brings 30-60 referrals from same 10-15 SCs as relationships deepen

**Pro Tip:** When you join MD Home Care's allied health network, you're automatically introduced to 50+ support coordinators connected through the platform. This accelerates your SC relationship-building by 6-12 months.

### 3. Offer Mobile Physiotherapy Services - Key Differentiator

**Why mobile physio wins NDIS referrals:**

**Participant reality:**
- **65%** of NDIS participants with mobility needs cannot easily access clinic-based physio
- **Accessibility barriers:** Wheelchair users, participants without transport, rural/regional participants
- **Functional assessment need:** Physios need to see participants in their home environment for accurate mobility assessment
- **NDIS funding advantage:** Participants prefer spending funding on therapy, not transport to clinic

**Mobile Service Positioning:**

**What to offer:**
- Home visit physiotherapy (your primary service delivery model)
- Equipment brought to participant's home (resistance bands, weights, gait aids, etc.)
- Environmental assessment (home setup, furniture placement, floor surfaces affecting mobility)
- Functional task training in real environment (stairs, bathroom transfers, kitchen mobility)

**Marketing messaging:**

❌ **Don't say:** "We offer home visits as an option"
✅ **Do say:** "Mobile physiotherapy specialist - I bring the clinic to your home"

❌ **Don't say:** "Clinic in [suburb], home visits available"
✅ **Do say:** "Serving participants across [region] with mobile physiotherapy - no transport needed"

**Pricing for mobile service:**
- Standard NDIS rate: $193.99/hour (includes travel within 30km)
- Travel allowance: $64.66/hour (if participant is 30km+ from your base, bill up to 1 hour travel each way)
- Weekend/after-hours: $242.49/hour (+25% for evenings/weekends when mobility assessments in home are more realistic)

**Competitive advantage:** Most NDIS physios still operate clinic-first, home-visit-optional model. Positioning as mobile-first captures the 65% of participants who struggle with clinic access.

---

### 4. Specialize and Niche Down - Stand Out in NDIS Finder

**The problem with "general physiotherapy for NDIS participants":**
- Competes with 4,500+ other NDIS physios
- No clear value proposition
- Participants can't assess which physio is best for their specific condition

**The solution: Specialize in 1-2 NDIS physio niches**

**High-Demand NDIS Physio Specializations:**

**1. Stroke and Acquired Brain Injury Rehabilitation**
- Target participants: Post-stroke, traumatic brain injury, hypoxic brain injury
- NDIS funding: High allocation ($10,000-$20,000/year for intensive rehabilitation)
- Positioning: "Neurological physiotherapy specialist for stroke and ABI recovery"
- Key services: Gait retraining, upper limb function, balance and falls prevention

**2. Pediatric Developmental Physiotherapy**
- Target participants: Autism with motor delays, cerebral palsy, developmental coordination disorder
- NDIS funding: Early childhood intervention (0-7 years) + school-age supports
- Positioning: "Pediatric physio specialist for motor development and coordination"
- Key services: Gross motor skill development, sensory motor integration, play-based therapy

**3. Spinal Cord Injury and Wheelchair Mobility**
- Target participants: Spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy, complex mobility needs
- NDIS funding: Assistive technology (wheelchair prescription), ongoing mobility optimization
- Positioning: "Wheelchair and mobility specialist physiotherapist"
- Key services: Wheelchair assessment and prescription, pressure care, functional mobility training

**4. Falls Prevention and Frailty (Aged Care + NDIS)**
- Target participants: Older NDIS participants (65+), participants with balance disorders
- NDIS funding: Improved Daily Living, AT for gait aids
- Positioning: "Falls prevention specialist for NDIS and Home Care Package participants"
- Key services: Falls risk assessment, strength and balance programs, gait aid prescription

**5. Complex Care and High-Intensity Supports**
- Target participants: Participants requiring 24/7 support, SIL residents, complex medical needs
- NDIS funding: High allocation ($15,000+/year for participants with complex needs)
- Positioning: "Complex care physiotherapist for high-needs NDIS participants"
- Key services: Respiratory physio, spasticity management, contracture prevention

**How to implement specialization:**

**Update NDIS Provider Finder:**
- Service description: "[Specialization] - I specialize in physiotherapy for [participant type]"
- Example: "Neurological Physiotherapy - Stroke & Brain Injury Rehabilitation Specialist"

**Website and Google Business:**
- Home page headline: "[Specialization] Physiotherapist | NDIS Registered | [Region]"
- Service pages for each specialization with detailed descriptions

**Support coordinator communication:**
- Position yourself as "the physio for [condition]" rather than generalist
- SCs remember specialists for specific participant needs

**Expected impact:**
- **Conversion rate increase:** 15-20% → 35-45% (participants seeking specialist find clear match)
- **Referral quality:** Higher-value participants with specific needs you excel at serving
- **Word-of-mouth:** Specialists get recommended ("You need a stroke physio? Call [Your Name]")

---

### 5. Partner with Disability Service Organizations - Embedded Referrals

**How it works:** Disability service organizations (like MD Home Care) deliver support services to hundreds of NDIS participants. These participants often need physiotherapy but don't know how to find a physio or which one to choose. The service organization recommends trusted physios they've partnered with.

**Types of disability service organizations to partner with:**

**1. SIL Providers (Supported Independent Living)**
- Participants: Living in group homes, 24/7 support, often with complex mobility needs
- Physio needs: Falls prevention, manual handling assessments, mobility optimization
- Partnership model: Quarterly physio reviews for all SIL residents, on-call for injuries/assessments
- **MD Home Care operates 15+ SIL properties** - network physios provide regular reviews

**2. Community Access Providers**
- Participants: Accessing community activities, social outings, recreation programs
- Physio needs: Mobility assessments for community participation, falls prevention
- Partnership model: Pre-activity physio clearance, group exercise programs

**3. Personal Care Providers**
- Participants: Receiving in-home personal care, domestic assistance
- Physio needs: Mobility optimization, safe transfer training for support workers
- Partnership model: Physio training for support workers, participant mobility assessments
- **MD Home Care connects 300+ participants with personal care providers** - network physios can train support workers on safe manual handling

**4. Plan Management Organizations**
- Participants: Using plan managers to handle NDIS invoicing
- Physio needs: Reliable providers who invoice correctly
- Partnership model: Preferred provider list, fast payment processing

**How to approach disability service organizations:**

**Email template:**
```
Subject: Physiotherapy Partnership for Your NDIS Participants

Hi [Organization Contact],

I'm [Your Name], a registered NDIS physiotherapist specializing in [specialization] and serving participants across [region].

I noticed that [Organization] supports NDIS participants with [service type], many of whom likely need physiotherapy for mobility, falls prevention, or rehabilitation.

I'd like to explore a partnership where I can provide:
- Regular physio assessments for your participants (quarterly reviews or as-needed)
- Training for your support workers on safe manual handling and mobility assistance
- Responsive service for participant injuries or mobility changes
- Coordinated care with your support coordinators and care managers

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss how physiotherapy can enhance the care you provide?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Phone] | [NDIS Registration #]
```

**Expected timeline:**
- **6-12 months** to establish organizational partnerships
- **2-5 referrals per quarter** per organization (varies by organization size)
- **Long-term value:** Once embedded, consistent monthly referrals for years

**Fastest path:** Join MD Home Care's allied health network to connect with 500+ participants searching for providers, rather than spending 6-12 months building your own organizational partnerships.

## Case Study: Building a Sustainable NDIS Physio Practice

**Provider:** James Thompson, Physiotherapist (Sydney Western Suburbs)
**Background:** 6 years physio experience, new to NDIS
**Goal:** Build full-time NDIS practice (20-25 participants/week)

**Timeline:**

**Month 1-4: Solo Marketing (Struggling)**
- Optimized NDIS Provider Finder profile
- Google Ads: $600/month budget
- Created website and social media
- **Results:** 3-5 inquiries/month, 20% conversion = 1 client/month

**Month 5: Strategy Shift - Applied to MD Home Care Network**
- Joined MD Home Care allied health network
- Specialized positioning: "Neurological physiotherapy for stroke and brain injury"
- Committed to mobile-first service delivery
- **Results:** First 2 referrals within 3 weeks

**Month 5-8: Building Momentum**
- MD Home Care referrals: 2-3/month (stroke participants, SIL residents with mobility needs)
- SC introductions through MD Home Care: Met 8 support coordinators
- Direct SC referrals (independent of MD Home Care): Started getting 1-2/month
- **Results:** 5-6 new clients monthly

**Month 9-12: Established Practice**
- MD Home Care network referrals: Consistent 3-4/month
- SC relationships (built through network): 3-4/month
- NDIS Finder (specialist positioning): 1-2/month
- **Results:** Full caseload of 22-25 participants

**Current State (18 months):**
- **Active caseload:** 25 participants (ongoing weekly or fortnightly sessions)
- **Monthly revenue:** $16,000-$22,000
- **Client acquisition cost:** $0 (network + SC referrals) vs previous $300/client (Google Ads)
- **Referral sources:**

  - Word-of-mouth: 10%

**James's Insights:**

*"I wasted 4 months and $2,400 on Google Ads trying to attract NDIS participants directly. The breakthrough came when I realized NDIS participants don't search for physios on Google - they ask their support coordinators or disability service providers. Joining MD Home Care's network gave me instant access to participants who already trusted the organization, plus introductions to support coordinators I never would have met on my own. The specialist positioning (stroke and brain injury) helped me stand out with both SCs and participants. Within 18 months I had a full practice earning $200k+/year."*

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to get first NDIS physio client?

**Timeline by acquisition channel:**
- **Provider network (MD Home Care):** 2-4 weeks after onboarding
- **Support coordinator partnerships:** 1-3 months to build relationships
- **NDIS Finder:** 2-8 weeks for first inquiry (conversion varies)
- **Organizational partnerships:** 3-6 months

**Recommended:** Start with provider network (fastest results) while simultaneously building SC relationships for long-term sustainability.

### Do I need to offer mobile physiotherapy or can I stay clinic-based?

**For NDIS success, mobile service is essential.** 65% of NDIS participants with mobility needs cannot easily access clinic-based physio due to:
- Wheelchair accessibility barriers
- Transport challenges
- Cognitive impairments (unfamiliar clinic environments cause anxiety)
- Need for functional assessment in home environment

**Clinic-only physios get 30-40% fewer NDIS referrals** than mobile-capable physios. Support coordinators preferentially refer to mobile physios because it solves participant access problems.

**Minimum mobile service model:**
- Home visits as primary delivery (80%+ of sessions)
- Clinic available for participants who prefer it (20%)
- Equipment portable (resistance bands, weights, gait aids fit in car)

### Can I join MD Home Care network if I'm not NDIS registered?

**Yes, with conditions.** If you're not NDIS registered as a sole provider, you can still work with:
- Plan-managed participants (70% of MD Home Care participants)
- Self-managed participants (10% of MD Home Care participants)

You cannot work with agency-managed participants (20%) until NDIS registered.

**We recommend:** Start NDIS registration process (3-6 months) while working with plan/self-managed participants through the network.

### How many referrals should I expect per month from MD Home Care?

**Typical referral volume:** 4-8 participants/month, depending on:

**Your availability:**
- 15-20 hours/week: 4-5 referrals/month
- 25+ hours/week: 6-8 referrals/month

**Your specialization:**
- High-demand (stroke, pediatric, SCI): 6-8 referrals/month
- General physio: 4-6 referrals/month

**Your region:**
- Sydney Western suburbs: Higher volume
- Melbourne South East: Moderate-high volume

**Note:** Referrals fluctuate based on participant needs and are not guaranteed, but MD Home Care's 500+ participant base ensures consistent flow.

### What's the difference between MD Home Care network vs other allied health networks?

**MD Home Care Advantages:**

**1. Integrated disability service provider:**
- Participants already receive support services (SIL, personal care, community access)
- You're part of holistic care team, not isolated provider
- RN clinical oversight identifies physio needs during care reviews

**2. Support coordinator relationships:**
- 50+ independent SCs work with MD Home Care participants
- Network physios get introduced to these SCs
- Referral multiplication beyond just MD Home Care participants

**3. Quality over volume:**
- We pre-qualify referrals (funding confirmed, clear goals)
- Participants engaged and motivated (already connected with providers through MD Home Care)
- Higher conversion and retention rates

**Other networks** may offer higher referral volume but less integration, support, or quality control.
