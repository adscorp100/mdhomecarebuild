## NDIS Support Plan Template: Key Points
- An NDIS support plan is a participant-centered document that outlines goals, funded supports, budgets, and strategies for achieving desired outcomes.
- Support plans should be co-designed with participants, reflecting their voice, choices, and aspirations for an ordinary life.
- Plans must align with the participant's NDIS plan budget across core supports, capacity building, and capital supports.
- Regular reviews (at least annually) ensure the support plan remains relevant and effective as participant needs and goals evolve.

## What is an NDIS Support Plan?

An NDIS support plan (also called "My Support Plan" or "My Plan") is a working document that translates a participant's NDIS plan into actionable goals and support strategies. While the NDIS plan is the official funding document created by the NDIA, the support plan is a practical tool that guides day-to-day service delivery.

The support plan serves several important purposes:
- **Personalization**: Makes the formal NDIS plan personal and meaningful to the participant
- **Goal clarity**: Breaks down aspirations into achievable, measurable steps
- **Budget management**: Tracks how funding is allocated across different supports
- **Communication tool**: Helps everyone involved understand the participant's goals and needs
- **Progress tracking**: Provides a framework for monitoring and celebrating achievements

## Who Creates an NDIS Support Plan?

### Participant-Led Planning
The most empowering approach:
- Participant drives the planning process
- Family members or supporters provide input as requested
- Support coordinator or plan manager facilitates if needed
- Provider services align with the participant's plan

### Support Coordinator-Assisted
For participants who need help:
- Support coordinator leads planning conversations
- Participant shares goals, preferences, and priorities
- Coordinator translates these into structured plan
- Participant reviews and approves final plan

### Provider-Developed
For service-specific planning:
- Provider creates plan specific to their services
- Must align with overall NDIS plan and goals
- Participant reviews and provides input
- Forms part of the broader support planning approach

## Essential Elements of an NDIS Support Plan

A comprehensive support plan should include these key components.

## How to Create an NDIS Support Plan: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Prepare for the Planning Conversation
Before you begin:
- Read the participant's NDIS plan thoroughly
- Understand budget allocations and funded supports
- Gather information about current supports and services
- Schedule enough time for a meaningful conversation
- Choose a comfortable, private setting
- Have the participant invite support people if they wish

### Step 2: Start with Strengths and Aspirations
Begin positively:
- Ask about strengths, interests, and what's going well
- Explore hopes and dreams for the future
- Discuss what an "ordinary life" means to them
- Identify natural supports and community connections
- Understand what brings joy and meaning

**Good Questions:**
- What makes a good day for you?
- What would you like to do more of?
- If you could change one thing about your life, what would it be?
- Who are the important people in your life?
- What are you proud of achieving?

### Step 3: Develop Meaningful Goals
Co-create goals with the participant:
- Listen to aspirations and priorities
- Help articulate goals in specific terms
- Ensure goals are participant-driven, not service-driven
- Link goals to NDIS plan outcomes
- Make goals SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Include both short-term and long-term goals

**Focus on Outcomes, Not Services:**
- Good: "I want to make new friends and join a sports team"
- Service-focused: "I want to access community participation support"

### Step 4: Identify Supports and Strategies
For each goal, determine:
- What funded NDIS supports will help
- What informal supports can contribute
- What mainstream services are available
- What skills or resources are needed
- Who will provide each type of support
- When and where supports will be delivered

### Step 5: Allocate Budget
Map supports to budget categories:
- Review available funding in each category
- Assign supports to appropriate budget lines
- Ensure essential supports are prioritized
- Check that budget is adequate for planned supports
- Identify any gaps or shortfalls
- Plan for flexible use of funding

### Step 6: Add Health, Safety, and Communication Information
Include practical details:
- Medical conditions and medications
- Communication preferences and needs
- Cultural or religious considerations
- Risk management strategies
- Emergency contacts and procedures
- Preferred routines and approaches

### Step 7: Document in Clear, Accessible Language
Write the plan:
- Use first person ("I want" not "The participant wants")
- Use plain, simple language
- Avoid jargon and acronyms
- Keep sentences short and clear
- Use headings and bullet points
- Include pictures or symbols if helpful

### Step 8: Review and Approve with Participant
Before finalizing:
- Read through the entire plan with the participant
- Check that it accurately reflects their words and priorities
- Make any requested changes
- Ensure they understand all sections
- Get their sign-off and approval
- Provide a copy in their preferred format

### Step 9: Share with Support Team
Distribute the plan to:
- Participant (their copy to keep)
- Family or support persons (with participant consent)
- Support coordinator or plan manager
- Key service providers
- Others the participant wants to include

### Step 10: Implement, Monitor, and Review
Put the plan into action:
- Arrange or confirm provider services
- Set up regular progress check-ins
- Track goal progress and celebrate achievements
- Adjust strategies as needed
- Conduct formal reviews at scheduled times
- Update the plan when circumstances change

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Creating Support Plans

### Service-Driven Rather Than Person-Driven
- **Problem**: Plan focuses on services to be delivered rather than participant's goals
- **Solution**: Start with aspirations and work backwards to identify needed supports

### Vague or Unmeasurable Goals
- **Problem**: Goals like "be happier" or "improve skills"
- **Solution**: Use specific, measurable terms ("make 2 new friends," "cook 3 meals independently per week")

### Overly Complex Language
- **Problem**: Plan written in formal, professional language the participant doesn't understand
- **Solution**: Use plain language, first person, and accessible formats

### Lack of Participant Voice
- **Problem**: Plan written by professionals without genuine participant input
- **Solution**: Co-design the plan with the participant, capturing their words and priorities

### Unrealistic Goals
- **Problem**: Goals that are too ambitious or not aligned with available supports
- **Solution**: Balance aspiration with achievability, break big goals into smaller steps

### Ignoring Informal Supports
- **Problem**: Plan only lists funded services, ignoring family and community supports
- **Solution**: Map all supports - funded, informal, and mainstream

### No Review Schedule
- **Problem**: Plan created once and never revisited
- **Solution**: Set regular review dates and update as circumstances change

### Missing Critical Information
- **Problem**: No emergency contacts, medical information, or risk management
- **Solution**: Include comprehensive health, safety, and contact details

## NDIS Support Plan vs. NDIS Plan: Understanding the Difference

Many people confuse these two important documents.

### NDIS Plan (Official Funding Document)
- Created by the NDIA after planning meeting
- Lists approved supports and funding amounts
- Legally binding funding agreement
- Outlines plan management type
- Covers 12 or 24 months
- Required for accessing NDIS-funded supports

### NDIS Support Plan (Working Document)
- Created by participant, coordinator, or provider
- Details how funding will be used to achieve goals
- Guides day-to-day support delivery
- Can be updated anytime as needs change
- More detailed and personalized
- Working tool for participants and providers

**Relationship:**
The NDIS support plan operationalizes the NDIS plan. It takes the approved funding and translates it into meaningful goals and support strategies.

## Frequently Asked Questions About NDIS Support Plans

**Do I have to have a support plan?**
No, support plans are not mandatory. However, they're highly recommended as they help you get the most from your NDIS plan and track progress towards goals.

**Who keeps the support plan?**
The participant keeps their own copy. Copies should also be given to the support coordinator, plan manager, and key providers with the participant's consent.

**Can I update my support plan whenever I want?**
Yes. Unlike your NDIS plan which is set for 12-24 months, your support plan can be updated anytime as your needs, goals, or circumstances change.

**What's the difference between a support plan and a service agreement?**
A support plan outlines your goals and how supports will help you achieve them. A service agreement is a contract with a specific provider about the services they'll deliver.

**Do all my providers need a copy of my support plan?**
Only if you want them to have one. Share your plan with providers who need to understand your goals to deliver effective supports.

**Can my family help create my support plan?**
Yes, family members can provide input and support the planning process, especially if you request their involvement. However, the plan should reflect your goals and choices.

**What if my goals change?**
Update your support plan to reflect your new goals. This is normal and encouraged - it shows you're growing and evolving.

**How detailed should my support plan be?**
Detailed enough to be useful, but not so detailed it's overwhelming. Focus on what's most important to you and what providers need to know to support you effectively.
