## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Eligibility

**Can I apply for NDIS if I'm over 65?**
No, you must be under 65 when first applying for NDIS. If you're already an NDIS participant, you can continue receiving supports after turning 65.

**What if my condition might improve?**
The NDIS covers permanent disabilities. However, some conditions with uncertain prognosis may qualify if current functional impact is significant and permanence is likely based on medical opinion.

**Do I need a specific diagnosis to be eligible?**
While a diagnosis helps, it's not always essential. The focus is on functional impact and support needs rather than specific diagnostic labels.

### Application Process

**How long does the eligibility process take?**
NDIA aims to make eligibility decisions within 21 days of receiving complete applications. Complex cases may take longer, particularly if additional information is required.

**Can I get help with my application?**
Yes, you can get assistance from Local Area Coordinators, disability advocacy services, or private support coordinators to help prepare and submit your application.

**What happens if I'm not eligible?**
You'll receive a letter explaining why you weren't eligible and information about review options. You can request an internal review or seek additional medical evidence to reapply.

### Support During Application

**Can I access supports while waiting for a decision?**
Limited supports may be available through Local Area Coordinators or community programs while your application is being processed, but formal NDIS supports begin after eligibility is confirmed.
