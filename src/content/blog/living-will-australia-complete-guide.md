## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between a living will and a regular will?
A living will (advance care directive) guides healthcare decisions while you're alive but unable to communicate your wishes. A regular will distributes your assets after death. Both are important but serve different purposes and are active at different times.

### Can I change my living will after I've signed it?
Yes, you can change your living will at any time while you have decision-making capacity. Create a new document, ensure it meets legal requirements, clearly revoke the previous version, and distribute the new version to all relevant parties.

### Do doctors have to follow my living will?
Doctors are generally required to follow legally valid living wills, but they may decline if the requested treatment is medically inappropriate or if their professional judgment conflicts with your directive. In such cases, they should help transfer your care to another provider who can honor your wishes.

### What happens if I don't have a living will?
Without a living will, healthcare decisions will be made by family members or court-appointed guardians based on what they believe you would want. This can lead to family conflicts, decisions that don't reflect your values, and emotional stress for loved ones.

### How much does it cost to create a living will in Australia?
Costs vary from free (using state-provided forms) to several hundred dollars for professional legal assistance. Most people can create a basic living will using free or low-cost resources, while complex situations may benefit from professional help.

### Do I need a lawyer to create a living will?
While not legally required, consulting a lawyer can be helpful, especially for complex medical or family situations. Many people successfully create living wills using state-provided forms and resources, but professional guidance ensures compliance with local laws and comprehensive coverage of your preferences.
