## Aged Care Risk Assessment Template: Key Points
- Risk assessments identify potential hazards across falls, medications, nutrition, infections, and behavioral challenges.
- Each identified risk must have a corresponding management strategy and be reviewed regularly (minimum annually or when conditions change).
- Risk assessments are mandatory for aged care accreditation and demonstrate duty of care obligations.
- Involving clients and families in risk assessment planning promotes person-centered care while maintaining safety.

## Strengthened Aged Care Quality Standards (November 2025)

The strengthened Aged Care Quality Standards took effect on 1 November 2025, alongside the new Aged Care Act 2024. These updated standards place greater emphasis on risk management across all aspects of aged care delivery.

**Standard 4: The Environment** specifically outlines the need for workers to have the time, support, resources, and ability to manage risk in care settings. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission has published [guidance on risk assessment and management in home care settings](https://www.agedcarequality.gov.au/resource-library/risk-assessment-and-management-home), explaining how providers should identify risks, implement controls, and review safety protocols.

Key changes relevant to risk assessment include:

- **Stronger clinical safety requirements** under Outcome 5.5, targeting high-impact and high-prevalence clinical areas of risk identified by the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety
- **Mandatory risk management frameworks** that must cover identification, assessment, mitigation, and review cycles
- **Non-conformance consequences** where providers who fail to demonstrate adequate risk management face actions based on the level of risk to older people
- **Person-centered approach** requiring older people and their families to be involved in identifying and managing risks

Providers using this template should ensure their risk assessment practices align with the strengthened standards. The template covers the major risk domains required for compliance, but should be adapted to reflect the specific services and settings of each provider.

## Why Risk Assessments Matter in Home Care

Risk assessment in home care presents unique challenges compared to residential settings. Care is delivered in environments that the provider does not control, which introduces variables such as home layout, existing hazards, equipment availability, and the presence of other household members.

Effective home care risk assessments should be completed:

- **Before services commence** to establish baseline risks
- **After any significant change** in the client's health, mobility, or living situation
- **At minimum annually** as part of ongoing care plan reviews
- **After any incident** such as a fall, medication error, or hospital admission

The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission expects providers to demonstrate a systematic approach to risk management. Having a structured template ensures consistency across assessments and provides an auditable record for quality reviews.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who should complete an aged care risk assessment?

Risk assessments should be completed by qualified staff, typically a registered nurse, care coordinator, or allied health professional. The assessment should involve the client and, where appropriate, their family members or carers.

### How often should risk assessments be reviewed?

At minimum annually, or whenever there is a significant change in the client's condition, living circumstances, or after an incident. The strengthened Aged Care Quality Standards require ongoing risk monitoring, not just periodic reviews.

### What happens if a risk assessment identifies a critical risk?

Critical risks require immediate action. This may include modifying the care plan, arranging additional supports, referring to specialist services, or in some cases, recommending alternative care arrangements. All actions taken must be documented.

### Are risk assessments required for Home Care Package recipients?

Yes. All aged care providers, including those delivering Home Care Packages and Commonwealth Home Support Programme services, must conduct risk assessments as part of their duty of care obligations under the Aged Care Act 2024.

### How does the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission assess risk management practices?

The Commission evaluates whether providers have systematic processes for identifying, assessing, and managing risks. During audits, they review documentation including risk assessments, care plans, incident reports, and evidence of ongoing monitoring and review.

## Summary

Comprehensive risk assessment is fundamental to safe aged care delivery. With the strengthened Aged Care Quality Standards now in effect, providers must demonstrate systematic risk management practices that protect older Australians while supporting person-centered care.
