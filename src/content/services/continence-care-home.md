### Frequently Asked Questions

**What happens during a continence assessment?**
A continence assessment is a private consultation with a qualified nurse. They will discuss your health history, bladder and bowel habits, and lifestyle. It's a respectful conversation aimed at understanding the cause of the incontinence to find the best solution. It is not invasive or embarrassing.

**Does NDIS or a Home Care Package cover the cost of an assessment?**
Yes, in most cases. A continence assessment is considered a crucial part of your care. We can help you confirm your eligibility and ensure the cost is correctly covered under your NDIS (Improved Daily Living) or Home Care Package budget, so you're not out of pocket.

**What if I'm not happy with a product or my support worker?**
Your comfort and satisfaction are our top priorities. We regularly review your care plan and welcome your feedback. If a product isn't right, we'll find a better alternative. If you're not a perfect match with your support worker, we will find someone who is.
