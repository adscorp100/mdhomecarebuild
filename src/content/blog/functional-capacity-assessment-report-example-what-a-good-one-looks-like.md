## Functional Capacity Assessment Report Example: Key Points
- A quality functional capacity assessment report provides comprehensive evidence of a person's abilities, limitations, and support needs across multiple life domains.
- Effective reports include observable evidence, standardized assessment results, and specific recommendations linked to individual goals.
- NDIS-compliant reports focus on functional impact rather than diagnosis and use person-centered, strength-based language.
- A well-structured report typically costs between $800-$1,500 and takes 6-10 hours to complete, including assessment, writing, and review.

## Understanding Functional Capacity Assessment Reports
A Functional Capacity Assessment (FCA) report is a comprehensive document prepared by qualified allied health professionals that evaluates a person's abilities and limitations in performing daily activities. These reports serve several critical purposes:

- **NDIS Applications and Reviews**: Providing evidence for initial access or plan reviews.
- **Support Coordination**: Guiding support coordinators in implementing effective supports.
- **Therapeutic Planning**: Informing therapists about priority areas for intervention.
- **Housing and Equipment**: Justifying needs for specialized housing or assistive technology.
- **Employment Assessments**: Identifying workplace accommodations and support requirements.

Quality FCA reports focus on observable function rather than medical diagnoses and offer specific, measurable, and achievable recommendations based on evidence-based assessments.

## Elements of an Exemplary Functional Capacity Assessment Report
An effective functional capacity assessment report includes several essential components:

- **Comprehensive Background Information**: Relevant medical, personal, and social history with clear links to current functional impacts.
- **Assessment Methodology**: Clear explanation of standardized assessment tools used and why they're appropriate.
- **Observable Evidence**: Specific examples of functional limitations observed during assessment.
- **Detailed Domain Analysis**: Thorough examination of abilities across mobility, self-care, communication, social interaction, learning, and self-management domains.
- **Goal-Aligned Recommendations**: Specific support suggestions directly connected to the person's stated goals.
- **Clear Support Quantification**: Precise details on type, frequency, and duration of recommended supports.
- **Person-Centered Language**: Respectful, strength-based terminology focusing on the individual, not just their disability.

These elements combine to create reports that effectively advocate for appropriate supports while maintaining the dignity and agency of the person being assessed.

## Annotated Functional Capacity Assessment Report Example
Below, we've included an excerpt from an exemplary functional capacity assessment report with annotations highlighting key features that make it effective:

## Comprehensive Guide to Functional Capacity Assessment Reports
Functional Capacity Assessment reports serve as critical evidence for NDIS funding, workplace accommodations, and therapeutic interventions. This comprehensive guide explores the components of exemplary reports, common pitfalls, and expert insights from allied health professionals on creating effective assessments in 2025.

### The Purpose and Impact of Functional Capacity Assessment Reports
A functional capacity assessment report documents an individual's abilities, limitations, and support needs through systematic observation and standardized assessment. These reports directly influence:

- **NDIS Funding Decisions**: The quality and specificity of evidence directly affects the supports funded in NDIS plans.
- **Independence Outcomes**: Appropriate recommendations enable people to maximize their independence and participation.
- **Resource Allocation**: Detailed justifications ensure the right supports are provided at the appropriate level.
- **Progress Measurement**: Well-documented baseline function allows for measuring improvement over time.
- **Legal and Administrative Decisions**: Reports may inform decisions about capacity, guardianship, or reasonable adjustments.

The importance of these reports cannot be overstated—they often determine whether a person receives life-changing supports or accommodations. A high-quality report can be the difference between adequate funding and insufficient resources that limit potential.

### Anatomy of an Effective Functional Capacity Assessment Report
While formats may vary, exemplary reports consistently include these detailed sections:

#### 1. Executive Summary
This provides a succinct overview (typically 1-2 paragraphs) of:
- Key findings across domains
- Primary recommendations
- Overall functional impact
- Prognosis for improvement with appropriate supports

For example: "Sarah demonstrates moderate limitations in mobility, mild limitations in self-care, and significant limitations in community access due to her cerebral palsy. With appropriate physical supports and skill development, Sarah can maintain her independent living and potentially increase her work hours as desired."

#### 2. Client Information and Assessment Context
This section establishes the foundation for the assessment:
- Demographic information
- Living situation
- Diagnosis and medical history relevant to function
- Current supports (formal and informal)
- Purpose of the assessment
- Client's self-reported goals
- Assessment settings, dates, and duration

The context should explain why the assessment was conducted, who requested it, and how the information will be used.

#### 3. Assessment Methodology
This section details:
- Standardized assessment tools used (with rationale for selection)
- Observational methods
- Interview sources (client, family, supporters)
- Documentation reviewed
- Specific activities observed
- Any adaptations to standard protocols

For example: "The Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS) was selected to provide standardized measurement of Sarah's daily living task performance. This assessment is particularly appropriate as it separates motor and cognitive aspects of task performance, allowing precise identification of where difficulties occur."

#### 4. Detailed Findings by Functional Domain
For each NDIS domain, effective reports include:

**Mobility:**
- Transfer abilities (bed, chair, toilet, car, etc.)
- Walking/wheeling distances and limitations
- Balance and stability
- Navigation abilities
- Public transport use
- Specific environmental barriers

**Self-care:**
- Personal hygiene capabilities and limitations
- Dressing abilities
- Medication management
- Toileting
- Eating and drinking
- Sleep routine management

**Communication:**
- Expressive communication methods and effectiveness
- Receptive understanding
- Alternative communication systems if used
- Technology use for communication
- Communication in different environments and contexts

**Social Interaction:**
- Relationship maintenance
- Understanding social cues
- Boundary awareness
- Community participation
- Social anxiety or challenges
- Strategies that support successful interaction

**Learning:**
- Information processing
- Memory function
- Attention and concentration
- Task sequencing abilities
- Skill acquisition methods that work well
- Learning barriers

**Self-management:**
- Financial management capabilities
- Decision-making processes
- Problem-solving approaches
- Planning and organization
- Time management
- Emotional regulation
- Risk awareness and safety

For each domain, the report should include:
- Standardized assessment scores where applicable
- Observed examples of both abilities and limitations
- Client's self-report of difficulties
- Comparison to age-expected function
- Environmental factors that help or hinder function
- Assistance currently required

#### 5. Comprehensive Recommendations
This critical section should include:
- Specific supports recommended with clear rationale
- Frequency, duration, and intensity of supports
- Skills development opportunities
- Environmental modifications
- Assistive technology recommendations with specifications
- Coordination requirements between different supports
- Training needed for support workers
- Measurable outcomes to indicate support effectiveness

For example: "Sarah requires support with meal preparation 3 times weekly (2 hours per session) to develop safer cutting techniques and meal planning skills. The support worker should have experience in modified cooking techniques for people with coordination difficulties. Success will be measured by Sarah's ability to independently prepare 5 simple healthy meals by the 3-month review."

#### 6. Implementation Considerations
This forward-looking section addresses:
- Support worker requirements (skills, qualifications)
- Safety considerations
- Coordination between different providers
- Environmental adaptations needed
- Training recommendations
- Suggested review timeframes
- Potential triggers for reassessment

#### 7. Assessor Declaration and Qualifications
The report concludes with:
- Assessor credentials and experience relevant to the assessment
- Professional registration details
- Declaration of compliance with relevant codes and standards
- Signature and date
- Contact information for clarification questions

### Expert Insights: What Allied Health Professionals Emphasize
We interviewed experienced occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and speech pathologists specializing in functional assessments. They highlighted these critical elements:

#### From Rebecca Wong, Senior Occupational Therapist:
"The most common mistake I see is focusing too much on what a person can't do rather than building a complete picture of their strengths, strategies, and specific support needs. A good report clearly shows what happens without support, what improves with support, and how that aligns with the person's goals."

#### From Michael Patton, Physiotherapist:
"Quantifiable measures make all the difference. Instead of saying 'difficulty walking long distances,' I specify 'walks 50 meters before requiring a 2-minute rest due to increased pain and fatigue.' This precision helps planners understand exactly what support is needed."

#### From Aisha Malik, Speech Pathologist:
"I always include direct quotes from the person I'm assessing. Their own description of challenges often provides the most compelling evidence and ensures their voice is central to the report. I also carefully document how communication varies across different environments, as this is often overlooked."

### Common Weaknesses in Functional Capacity Assessment Reports
Based on our analysis of reports and feedback from NDIS planners, these issues frequently undermine report effectiveness:

1. **Overreliance on Diagnosis**: Focusing on medical conditions rather than functional impact.
2. **Vague Support Recommendations**: Failing to specify exact support needs (e.g., "requires regular assistance" instead of "requires 3 hours weekly of cooking support").
3. **Missing Evidence**: Making claims about limitations without documented evidence or observations.
4. **Deficit-Only Focus**: Failing to acknowledge capabilities and strengths that could be built upon.
5. **Clinical Language**: Using technical terms without explanation, making reports inaccessible to the person being assessed.
6. **Lack of Context**: Failing to explain how functional limitations affect the person's specific life circumstances and goals.
7. **Generic Templates**: Using standard text that doesn't reflect the individual's unique situation.
8. **Ignoring Fluctuations**: Not addressing how function may vary based on day, environment, or health status.

### Step-by-Step Process for Creating an Exemplary Report
Allied health professionals follow this process to develop comprehensive, effective reports:

#### 1. Preparation (1-2 hours)
- Review referral information and previous reports
- Contact the person to explain the assessment process
- Identify appropriate assessment tools based on the person's situation
- Plan assessment locations (home, community, workplace, etc.)
- Coordinate with family members or support people if needed

#### 2. Assessment (3-6 hours)
- Conduct structured interviews with the person and significant others
- Administer standardized assessments appropriate to the domains being evaluated
- Observe natural performance of daily tasks
- Document specific examples of function and challenges
- Take photos or videos (with consent) of environmental factors or techniques
- Gather information about current supports and their effectiveness

#### 3. Analysis (1-2 hours)
- Score standardized assessments
- Compare findings across different assessment methods
- Identify patterns of strengths and limitations
- Consider environmental impacts on function
- Analyze the gap between current function and the person's goals
- Research appropriate support options and assistive technology

#### 4. Report Writing (3-4 hours)
- Structure information logically by domain
- Include specific examples and observations
- Ensure recommendations directly link to identified functional needs
- Use clear, respectful language
- Include the person's perspective throughout
- Provide evidence-based justification for all recommendations

#### 5. Review and Refinement (1 hour)
- Check that all domains are addressed comprehensively
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Verify that the person's goals are central to recommendations
- Eliminate jargon or explain technical terms
- Consider having a colleague review for clarity and completeness

#### 6. Discussion with the Person (1 hour)
- Review findings and recommendations with the person
- Address any concerns or misunderstandings
- Incorporate additional feedback as appropriate
- Ensure the person understands how to use the report effectively

This process typically requires 10-15 hours of professional time, explaining the cost range of $800-$1,500 for comprehensive assessments.

### Functional Capacity Assessment Reports: Special Considerations
Different situations require tailored approaches:

#### For Children
- Include developmental expectations as a reference point
- Address function in home, educational, and play contexts

#### For Psychosocial Disability
- Document episodic nature of function if relevant
- Include cognitive and emotional aspects of task performance
- Address energy limitations and fatigue
- Consider sensory needs and environmental triggers
- Detail supports that prevent deterioration during difficult periods

#### For Progressive Conditions
- Document current function alongside expected progression
- Address preventive supports to maintain function longer
- Include contingency recommendations for managing decline
- Consider timing for introduction of different support types

#### For Assistive Technology
- Include specific product recommendations with features required
- Address training needs for effective use
- Document trials of equipment where conducted
- Provide maintenance and replacement timeline considerations

### Sample Report Excerpts by Domain
The following excerpts from actual reports (with identifying details changed) demonstrate best practice documentation in different domains:

#### Mobility Domain Example
```
Mrs. Chen's mobility is significantly impacted by her Parkinson's disease. During assessment, she demonstrated:

• Indoor mobility: Walks with shuffling gait using a 4-wheeled walker. Can walk continuously for 45 meters before requiring rest due to fatigue. Freezing episodes observed when approaching doorways (3 instances during 1-hour observation).

• Transfers: Independent but slow for bed, chair, and toilet transfers (each taking 30-40 seconds). Requires minimal assistance for bath transfers due to fear of falling.

• Stairs: Can manage 4-5 steps with handrail and supervision but reports avoiding stairs whenever possible due to fear of falling.

• Outdoor mobility: Cannot safely navigate uneven surfaces. Curbs and slopes present significant challenges, requiring physical assistance. Public transport use limited by difficulty stepping onto buses and managing in crowded environments.

Berg Balance Scale score: 35/56, indicating moderate fall risk.
Timed Up and Go Test: 22 seconds (>12 seconds indicates increased fall risk)

Mrs. Chen reports one fall in the past month when trying to answer the telephone quickly. She currently avoids community outings unless accompanied.
```

#### Self-management Domain Example
```
James demonstrates variable capacity in self-management tasks:

• Financial management: Can handle small day-to-day purchases but struggles with budgeting for larger expenses. During observed money management tasks, made errors in calculating change for amounts over $20. Banking requires assistance due to difficulty understanding online systems.

• Problem-solving: When presented with everyday problems (e.g., simulated situation of missed appointment), James needed prompting to identify potential solutions. Once solutions were identified, he could select appropriate options with minimal guidance.

• Planning and organization: Uses smartphone reminders effectively for regular appointments. However, struggles with planning sequential tasks. During meal preparation observation, had difficulty planning the order of tasks, resulting in inefficient workflow and one safety concern (leaving hotplate on).

• Emotional regulation: Self-reports difficulty managing frustration when tasks are challenging. During assessment, demonstrated appropriate self-calming strategies (deep breathing, brief breaks) when encouraged, but did not initiate these independently when showing signs of frustration.

Executive Function Performance Test score: 15/24, indicating moderate assistance needs with complex self-management tasks.
```
