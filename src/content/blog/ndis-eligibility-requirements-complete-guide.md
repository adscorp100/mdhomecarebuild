## Understanding NDIS Eligibility

The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) provides support to Australians with permanent and significant disability. Understanding eligibility requirements is the first step toward accessing life-changing [supports and services](/blog/ndis-core-supports).

### Core NDIS Eligibility Criteria

**Age Requirements**
- Must be under 65 years old when first applying
- No upper age limit once accepted into the scheme
- Early intervention supports available for children under 9
- Different pathways for children and adults

**Residency Requirements**
- Australian citizen, or
- Permanent resident (Australian permanent visa), or
- Protected Special Category Visa holder
- Must reside in Australia when applying
- Must live in an NDIS rollout area

**Disability Requirements**
- Permanent and significant disability
- Disability substantially reduces ability to participate effectively in activities

## NDIS Disability Requirements Explained

### What Counts as a Permanent Disability?

**Intellectual Disability**
- Significant limitations in intellectual functioning
- Adaptive behavior deficits
- Onset before 18 years of age
- Examples: Down syndrome, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, intellectual developmental disorder

**Physical Disability**
- Significant limitations in physical functioning
- Mobility, dexterity, or physical capacity restrictions
- Examples: Spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, limb deficiency

**Sensory Disability**
- Significant vision or hearing impairment
- Communication or mobility limitations
- Examples: Blindness, deafness, deaf-blindness, severe vision impairment

**Neurological Disability**
- Brain or nervous system conditions
- Progressive or stable conditions
- Examples: Multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, acquired brain injury, Parkinson's disease

**Psychosocial Disability**
- Mental health conditions with functional impact
- Significant psychosocial impairment
- Examples: Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe depression, PTSD

**Cognitive Disability**
- Information processing difficulties
- Learning and memory impairments
- Examples: Dementia, traumatic brain injury, autism spectrum disorder
- Global developmental delay
- Intellectual disability

### Early Intervention Requirements

**Children Under 9 Years**
- May qualify for early intervention supports
- Don't need to meet permanent disability requirements
- Must have developmental delay or disability
- Early intervention must be likely to benefit the child

**Examples of Early Intervention Conditions**
- Autism spectrum disorder

- Intellectual disability

**Thriving Kids: A New Pathway from 2028**

From January 2028, children under 9 with low to moderate autism or developmental delay will transition to the new Thriving Kids program rather than entering the NDIS. Unlike the NDIS, Thriving Kids will not require a formal diagnosis. Children with high support needs will still be eligible for the NDIS, and children already on the NDIS will not be affected. Families applying for early intervention supports should discuss both pathways with their Early Childhood Partner.

## NDIS Eligibility Assessment Process

Many applicants work with a [Local Area Coordinator (LAC)](/blog/what-is-a-local-area-coordinator-complete-guide) during this process, who can help guide them through the requirements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Eligibility

**Can I apply for NDIS if I'm over 65?**
No, you must be under 65 when first applying for NDIS. If you're already an NDIS participant, you can continue receiving supports after turning 65.

**What if my condition might improve?**
The NDIS covers permanent disabilities. However, some conditions with uncertain prognosis may qualify if current functional impact is significant and permanence is likely based on medical opinion.

**Do I need a specific diagnosis to be eligible?**
While a diagnosis helps, it's not always essential. The focus is on functional impact and support needs rather than specific diagnostic labels.

### Application Process

**How long does the eligibility process take?**
NDIA aims to make eligibility decisions within 21 days of receiving complete applications. Complex cases may take longer, particularly if additional information is required.

**Can I get help with my application?**
Yes, you can get assistance from Local Area Coordinators, disability advocacy services, or private support coordinators to help prepare and submit your application.

**What happens if I'm not eligible?**
You'll receive a letter explaining why you weren't eligible and information about review options. You can request an internal review or seek additional medical evidence to reapply.

### Support During Application

**Can I access supports while waiting for a decision?**
Limited supports may be available through Local Area Coordinators or community programs while your application is being processed, but formal NDIS supports begin after eligibility is confirmed.
