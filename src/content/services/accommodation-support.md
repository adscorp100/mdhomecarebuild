# Feeling Overwhelmed by NDIS Housing Options? Let's Make It Simple.

Finding the right home for yourself or a loved one is one of the most important parts of the NDIS journey. But the system can be incredibly confusing, with a lot of acronyms and complex rules.

You're not alone if you feel lost. Most people are confused by the two main types of NDIS housing support: **Supported Independent Living (SIL)** and **Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA)**.

This page is a simple guide to help you understand the difference and figure out which path is right for you.

---

## First, a Simple Question: What Do You Need Help With?

The easiest way to understand NDIS housing is to ask: are you looking for funding for the **support services *in* your home**, or for the **specialist home *itself*?**

*   If you need funding for **people** to help you with daily life, you're likely looking for **SIL**.
*   If you need funding for the physical, purpose-built **house or apartment**, you're likely looking for **SDA**.

Let's break them down.

## Path 1: Supported Independent Living (SIL)

### What is it?
SIL is NDIS funding for the support services you receive in your home. It's designed to help you live as independently as possible. This is the most common type of housing support.

### Who is it for?
SIL is for people who need a significant amount of help with daily tasks. This could include:
*   Needing help with personal care like showering and dressing.
*   Assistance with cooking, cleaning, and managing a household.
*   Supervision and support to stay safe at home.
*   Shared support with housemates in a group home environment.

**In simple terms: SIL is about funding the *people* who support you at home.**

## Path 2: Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA)

### What is it?
SDA is NDIS funding for the physical home itself. It's for homes that have been specially designed or built for people with very high support needs.

### Who is it for?
SDA is for a smaller number of NDIS participants with extreme functional impairment or very high support needs. This means you need a specialised home to live safely. This could include a home with:
*   Ceiling hoists and other mobility equipment.
*   Automated doors and windows.
*   Reinforced walls and ceilings.
*   A design that makes it easy for support workers to help you.

**In simple terms: SDA is about funding the *bricks and mortar* of a specialist home.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I have both SIL and SDA funding?**
Yes. If you have very high support needs that require you to live in a specialist home, you will likely have funding for both. The SDA pays for your home, and the SIL pays for the support you receive in that home.

**What if I don't qualify for SDA?**
Most NDIS participants do not have SDA funding. If you don't qualify for SDA, you can still receive SIL funding to help you live independently in a regular rental property, community housing, or your own home.

**Where do I start?**
The best place to start is with a conversation. Understanding your specific needs and goals is the first step to finding the right housing solution.
