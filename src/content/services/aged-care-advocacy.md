> #### **"Hiring Them Was the Best Money We Spent."**
>
> "My siblings and I were tearing our hair out trying to understand my mum's home care options. We were getting conflicting advice and felt completely lost. We engaged MD Home Care's navigation service, and it was like a weight was lifted. Our navigator laid out all the options, helped us choose a fantastic provider, and even reviewed the contract. We would have wasted so much time and money without her." - *David L., {suburb}*

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How is this different from a free advocacy service like OPAN?**
OPAN provides a crucial, government-funded service to uphold basic rights. Our Navigation Service is a private, professional consultancy for families who want a higher level of hands-on, expert support. We don't just advise; we can manage the entire process for you, from research and phone calls to provider negotiation and issue resolution.

**Are you truly independent?**
Yes. While we are an approved aged care provider, our Navigation Service is a separate, fee-for-service consultancy. Our primary duty is to you, our client. Our goal is to use our industry expertise to get you the best possible outcome, regardless of which provider you ultimately choose.

**What are your fees?**
We offer an initial consultation for a fixed fee. From there, we can provide a tailored quote for a package of services based on your specific needs. Our goal is to provide exceptional value by saving you time, reducing your stress, and ensuring you get the most out of your loved one's funding.
