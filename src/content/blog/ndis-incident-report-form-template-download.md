## What is an NDIS Incident Report?

An NDIS incident report is a formal document that records any event involving an NDIS participant that deviates from expected service delivery or results in actual or potential harm. It serves as both an internal record and, for reportable incidents, the basis for mandatory notification to the NDIS Commission.

The incident report serves several critical purposes:
- **Participant safety**: Identifies risks and triggers protective responses
- **Legal compliance**: Meets mandatory reporting obligations under the NDIS Act
- **Quality improvement**: Provides data for analyzing patterns and preventing future incidents
- **Accountability**: Creates an auditable trail of events and responses
- **Transparency**: Demonstrates commitment to open reporting culture
