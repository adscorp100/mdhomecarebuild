Understanding NDIS support worker pay rates can be confusing. There's a difference between what the NDIS pays providers (the Price Guide), what providers must pay workers (the SCHADS Award), and what workers actually take home.

This guide breaks down all the rates for 2025, including the July 2025 wage increase, public holiday penalty rates, night shift loadings, and real-world earnings for different scenarios.

## NDIS Pay Rate Changes July 2025

As of 1 July 2025, the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits were updated with a **3.95% increase** to price limits for disability support worker services, reflecting the Fair Work Commission's annual wage review.

**Key points:**
- NDIS price limits (what participants pay) increased by 3.95%
- SCHADS Award minimum wages (what workers receive) also increased
- The increase applies to all support types and shift times

## Understanding the Two Rate Systems

### NDIS Price Guide vs SCHADS Award

| Aspect | NDIS Price Guide | SCHADS Award |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| **What it is** | Maximum price providers can charge | Minimum wage providers must pay |
| **Who sets it** | NDIA (National Disability Insurance Agency) | Fair Work Commission |
| **Purpose** | Caps participant costs | Protects worker pay |
| **Typical weekday rate** | $67.56/hr (standard support) | $30-$40/hr (depending on level) |

The gap between these rates covers provider overheads: superannuation, insurance, workers compensation, leave entitlements, training, administration, and profit margin.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between the NDIS Price Guide and what support workers get paid?

The NDIS Price Guide sets the **maximum price providers can charge participants**. The SCHADS Award sets the **minimum wage providers must pay workers**. The difference covers employer costs like superannuation, insurance, workers compensation, and overheads.

### How much do NDIS support workers get paid per hour in 2025?

Under the SCHADS Award, support workers earn **$30-$57 per hour** depending on their classification level. Casual workers receive an additional 25% loading. Weekend and night shifts attract penalty rates that can more than double the base rate.

### Does the 3.95% increase go directly to support workers?

Not automatically. The 3.95% increase applies to NDIS price limits (what participants pay). Provider organisations decide whether to pass this on as wage increases. However, the SCHADS Award also increased in July 2025, raising minimum wages.

### What is Level 1, 2, 3 support worker?

Support worker levels reflect experience and qualifications:
- **Level 1:** Entry-level, basic personal care, works under supervision
- **Level 2:** Certificate III qualified, standard support duties
- **Level 3:** Certificate IV or extensive experience, complex care, specialised skills

### How does travel pay work for NDIS support workers?

Providers can claim travel time between participants (capped at 30 mins metro, 60 mins regional). Workers should be paid for this travel time. Kilometre allowance is $0.99/km when using a personal vehicle.

### Are NDIS rates the same in all states?

Yes, NDIS price limits are national—the same rates apply in QLD, VIC, NSW, SA, WA, TAS, NT, and ACT. The SCHADS Award is also federal, so minimum wages are consistent across states.

### What is TTP in NDIS pricing?

TTP (Temporary Transformation Payment) was a conditional loading providers could claim during NDIS transition. It's being phased out and replaced with the standard price limits.
