### What if I can't afford aged care costs?
Hardship provisions exist including fee reductions, payment deferrals, and additional government support. Contact Services Australia or your provider to discuss options.

### How often are aged care fees reviewed?
Government rates are reviewed annually (July 1), while individual assessments are reviewed annually or when circumstances change significantly.

### Does Medicare cover medical costs in aged care?
Medicare continues to cover GP visits, specialist consultations, PBS medications, and hospital admissions. Personal care and accommodation costs are separate.
