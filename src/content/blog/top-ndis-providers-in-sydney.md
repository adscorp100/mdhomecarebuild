## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do the July 2025 changes affect my current NDIS provider in Sydney?
The July 2025 changes affect different providers differently. **Travel funding cuts** primarily impact providers offering therapy services requiring travel, potentially increasing costs for services in outer Sydney areas. **Mandatory registration** for support coordination means all coordination services must now be NDIA-registered, which may affect smaller providers who previously operated unregistered. **New pricing arrangements** have reduced some therapy service limits while modestly increasing others. Your current provider should communicate any service changes directly to you. If they haven't, contact them to discuss how the changes affect your specific services.

### Which areas of Sydney are most affected by the travel funding cuts?
**Outer suburbs** including parts of Western Sydney, Northern Beaches, Hills District, and Sutherland Shire are most affected by the 50% travel funding cuts. **Inner Sydney areas** like the CBD, Inner West, and Eastern Suburbs experience minimal impact due to higher provider density and shorter travel distances. **Remote areas** of Sydney may see reduced service availability as providers reassess the viability of traveling long distances. Participants in affected areas should explore providers offering **telehealth options**, **group services**, or **local hub models** to maintain access to needed services.

### Can I still use unregistered providers in Sydney after July 2025?
**Support coordination services** must now use NDIA-registered providers only from July 1, 2025. For **other services**, the rules depend on your plan management type: **Agency-managed** participants must use registered providers for all services; **Plan-managed** participants can use either registered or unregistered providers, though plan managers may prefer registered ones; **Self-managed** participants can choose any provider, registered or unregistered. However, the pool of quality unregistered providers has decreased as many have sought registration to remain competitive in the market.

### How do I find the best disability support services Sydney for my specific needs?
Start by identifying your **specific support requirements** and **location preferences**. Use the [NDIS Provider Finder](https://www.ndis.gov.au/participants/working-providers/find-registered-provider/provider-finder) to search by location and service type. **Contact multiple providers** to discuss how they're adapting to 2025 changes and whether they can maintain service levels in your area. **Ask about alternative delivery methods** like telehealth or group sessions if travel funding affects your services. **Check provider reviews** and speak with other participants in your area about their experiences with different providers since the changes took effect.

### What should I do if my provider reduces services due to the 2025 changes?
First, **communicate with your current provider** to understand exactly which services are affected and explore alternative options they might offer. **Contact your Support Coordinator** (if you have one) to help identify alternative providers or service delivery methods. **Research providers** from our list who specifically maintain strong Sydney coverage despite the changes. **Consider telehealth options** where appropriate for therapy services. **Review your NDIS plan** to ensure you're maximizing available funding for alternative service arrangements. If necessary, **request a plan review** if service changes affect your ability to achieve your goals.

### How do the new pricing arrangements affect costs for participants?
**Therapy services** may become more expensive due to travel funding cuts, particularly for home-based services. Some providers may introduce **additional fees** for travel or offer **group sessions** to share travel costs. **Core support services** have seen modest price increases in some categories. **Registered providers** may have higher administration costs, potentially affecting pricing. The impact on **your out-of-pocket costs** depends on your plan funding, management type, and specific service choices. **Plan-managed and agency-managed** participants typically see minimal direct cost impact, while **self-managed** participants need to budget for potential price changes when selecting providers.

### Are there specific NDIS providers Sydney that specialize in cultural needs?
Yes, several **disability support providers Sydney** offer culturally responsive services. **Concept Care** specifically highlights cultural competency and employs staff from diverse backgrounds. **The Benevolent Society** offers Indigenous-specific programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participants. Many providers have **multilingual staff** speaking Arabic, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Korean, Greek, Italian, and Spanish.
