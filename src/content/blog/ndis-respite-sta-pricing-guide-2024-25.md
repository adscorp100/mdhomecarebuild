## What is NDIS Short-Term Accommodation and Respite Care?

The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) offers short-term accommodation (STA) and respite care to support people with disabilities and their caregivers. STA provides temporary housing and care, often for skill development or a change of environment, while respite care specifically gives caregivers a break, ensuring participants are cared for in a safe setting.

## Benefits and Pricing Structure

These services benefit both participants, by offering new experiences, and caregivers, by providing relief. Costs depend on factors like staff-to-participant ratios (1:1 to 1:4), the day of the week (higher on weekends and public holidays), and location (national, remote, very remote). The latest pricing, effective from October 1, 2024, is detailed below.

## How to Navigate Costs

To manage costs, plan ahead, compare providers, negotiate prices (as these are maximum limits), ask about all expenses (like travel or activities), and maintain clear communication with providers.

### Background and Context

The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is a government initiative in Australia designed to support people with disabilities through funding for various services, including STA and respite care. STA refers to temporary accommodation and care, often used for skill development or environmental change, while respite care specifically offers relief to caregivers, allowing them a break while ensuring participants receive support in a safe setting. Given the competitor's page, such as [United for Care's post](https://www.unitedforcare.com.au/post/ndis-price-guide-short-term-accommodation-assistance-respite), is ranking well but uses outdated 2023-24 pricing, there is an opportunity to provide fresher, more authoritative content.

### Research and Data Collection

To ensure accuracy, the latest NDIS pricing guide for 2024-25, effective from October 1, 2024, was reviewed. This information is available at [NDIS Pricing Arrangements 2024-25 PDF](https://www.ndis.gov.au/media/7150/download?attachment) and [NDIS Support Catalogue 2024-25](https://www.ndis.gov.au/media/7146/download?attachment). The analysis revealed that STA and respite care fall under "Core – Assistance with Daily Life," with pricing influenced by staff-to-participant ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4), day of the week (weekday, Saturday, Sunday, public holiday), and location (national, remote, very remote).

### Detailed Pricing Structure

The pricing limits, as extracted from the official documents, are critical for users seeking cost transparency. The table below outlines the maximum daily rates for STA and assistance, based on the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2024-25:

Additionally, for extra assistance with self-care activities during STA, hourly rates are provided, ranging from $67.56 for weekday daytime to $150.10 for public holidays in national locations. These rates ensure participants receive tailored support beyond standard packages.

### Benefits and User Value

STA and respite care offer significant benefits, including caregiver relief, participant skill development, and flexibility in service delivery. For caregivers, respite care provides a much-needed break, while participants can engage in new social and learning opportunities. These services are typically limited to 14 days per period, with an annual cap of 28 days, aligning with NDIS funding rules.

### Navigation and Cost Management

To help users manage costs, several strategies were identified:

- **Plan Proactively**: Determine the duration and specific needs for STA or respite care in advance.
- **Shop Around and Compare**: Research different providers to find the best fit in terms of services and cost, leveraging the price limits for negotiation.
- **Negotiate with Confidence**: Since these are maximum prices, participants and providers can agree on lower rates.
- **Ask About All Costs**: Ensure all potential additional expenses, such as travel, activities, and consumables, are clarified.
- **Maintain Clear Communication**: Keep open lines with providers to address any concerns or changes, ensuring transparency.

### Additional Hourly Rates

An unexpected detail is the inclusion of hourly rates for additional self-care assistance during STA, which allows for more personalized support. This feature, often overlooked, can significantly impact total costs and is crucial for participants with higher needs, offering a nuanced understanding beyond daily rates.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between NDIS Short-Term Accommodation (STA) and respite care?
Although the terms are often used interchangeably in the NDIS context, there are subtle differences: Short-Term Accommodation (STA) is the formal NDIS term for temporary, overnight accommodation with support services, designed for either skill development or providing relief for caregivers. Respite care specifically focuses on giving regular caregivers a break while ensuring the participant receives appropriate support. In practice, STA is the broader service category that includes respite care as one of its primary purposes. This distinction is mainly administrative, as the NDIS pricing structure applies the same rates to both. When discussing your needs with planners, focus on explaining the purpose (caregiver relief, skill development, etc.) rather than terminology.

### How is NDIS STA pricing calculated for 2024-25?
NDIS STA pricing for 2024-25 is calculated based on three key factors: (1) Staff-to-participant ratio - ranging from 1:1 (highest cost) to 1:4 (lowest cost) depending on support needs; (2) Day of the week - with standard weekday rates, higher Saturday rates (approximately 25% more), even higher Sunday rates (approximately 60% more), and the highest rates for public holidays (approximately 95% more); and (3) Location - with standard national rates, remote location loadings (40% more), and very remote loadings (50% more). For example, a 1:4 ratio standard weekday stay costs $684.96 nationally, while a 1:1 public holiday stay in a very remote location reaches $6,166.20 per day.

### Is transport to and from STA included in the NDIS pricing?
No, transport to and from STA facilities is not included in the daily STA rates shown in the pricing guide. Transport must be funded separately, typically from your Core Supports - Transport budget. Some options for covering this transport include: using your NDIS transport funding (if allocated in your plan), claiming provider travel costs when staff transport you to/from the accommodation, or using community or public transport if appropriate. Always discuss transport arrangements and associated costs with both your STA provider and Support Coordinator before booking, as unexpected transport expenses can significantly impact your overall budget. Some providers may offer transport as an additional service at extra cost.

### What happens if I need to cancel my STA booking?
As of October 2024, the NDIS cancellation policy requires 2 clear business days' notice for canceling STA bookings (reduced from the previous 7-day requirement for therapy services). If you cancel with less notice, providers can charge 100% of the agreed support price for the first day of the scheduled accommodation, though they cannot charge for subsequent days. For example, if you booked Monday to Wednesday but canceled on Sunday, you might be charged for Monday only. Many providers implement their own cancellation policies within these NDIS guidelines, so it's essential to check your service agreement for specific terms. Some providers may have more flexible policies, especially for emergency situations or illness, so discussing these scenarios in advance is recommended.

### Can I use my STA funding for a family vacation or holiday?
No, NDIS STA funding cannot be used for general family vacations or holidays. STA must directly relate to your disability support needs and align with the goals in your NDIS plan. To qualify as reasonable and necessary, STA stays typically need to serve purposes like: providing essential respite for unsustainable caregiving arrangements, building specific skills for independence in a supported environment, or testing alternative living arrangements. If you're planning a family vacation, only the disability-specific support and accommodation costs for the participant (not family members) might potentially be covered, and even then, strong justification would be required linking it to specific goals. In most cases, family holidays would need to be privately funded, while STA should be viewed as a disability support service rather than a recreational option.

### Are meals included in the STA daily rate?
Yes, standard meals and food costs are included in the daily STA rate. The NDIS price guide specifies that reasonable food costs are built into the daily prices shown in the tables. However, what's considered "reasonable" can vary between providers. Basic meals and snacks are always included, but specialty dietary requirements, premium food options, or dining out at restaurants during your stay might incur additional charges. If you have specific dietary needs related to your disability, these should be accommodated within the standard rate. When arranging STA, it's advisable to discuss meal arrangements in advance, including any dietary requirements, preferences, or plans for eating out, to avoid unexpected costs or misunderstandings during your stay.

### How many days of STA funding can I get in my NDIS plan?
The NDIS doesn't specify a fixed maximum number of STA days, instead basing allocations on individual needs and circumstances. However, typical allocations range from 14-28 days per year, often divided into shorter stays throughout the plan period. The exact number depends on factors like: the sustainability of your current care arrangements, the level of caregiver stress or fatigue, whether you have other formal or informal supports, and how STA aligns with your overall goals. STA is generally not intended as a long-term or regular accommodation solution but rather as periodic short-term stays. If your circumstances change (such as a primary caregiver facing health issues), you can request a plan review to potentially increase your STA allocation. For stays longer than 14 consecutive days, Medium Term Accommodation (MTA) might be more appropriate.
