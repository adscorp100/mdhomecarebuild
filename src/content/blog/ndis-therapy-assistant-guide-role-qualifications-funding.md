## Example: How Therapy Assistant Support Works

**Participant:** Alex, 22, cerebral palsy
**Goal:** Improve walking endurance and balance

**Traditional Approach:**
- 10 hours of physiotherapy @ $193.99/hr = $1,939.90
- Limited practice time between appointments

**Therapy Assistant Model:**
- 2 hours physiotherapy (assessment, plan) @ $193.99/hr = $387.98
- 16 hours therapy assistant (exercise practice) @ $71/hr = $1,136.00
- **Total: $1,523.98** for 18 hours of support vs 10 hours

**Outcome:** Alex gets nearly twice the contact hours within similar budget, with more frequent practice sessions leading to faster progress.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can a therapy assistant work without supervision?

No. All NDIS-funded therapy assistant services must be supervised by a registered allied health professional. The supervising therapist must sign off on all claims and be responsible for the therapy program.

### What's the difference between a therapy assistant and support worker?

Therapy assistants have specific qualifications (Certificate IV in Allied Health Assistance) and implement therapy programs under allied health supervision. Support workers provide general assistance with daily living but don't deliver therapeutic interventions. Therapy assistants are funded at a higher rate ($71/hr vs $35-65/hr for support workers) and work toward specific therapy goals.

### Can I become a therapy assistant without Certificate IV?

While Certificate IV is the standard requirement, some employers accept Certificate III with substantial relevant experience. However, Certificate IV is strongly recommended and increasingly expected by NDIS providers. It ensures you have the competencies to safely implement therapy programs.

### How do I find a supervising therapist if I'm self-employed?

Self-employed therapy assistants can establish supervision arrangements with allied health professionals in private practice. You'll need a formal agreement outlining supervision frequency, documentation requirements, and clinical oversight protocols. Some therapy practices actively seek therapy assistants to extend their service capacity.

### What NDIS line item covers therapy assistant services?

Therapy assistant services are claimed under Capacity Building - Improved Daily Living (Category 15). The specific line item is 15_038_0128_1_3 (Therapy Assistant). Funding comes from the participant's therapy allocation, not a separate category.

### Can therapy assistants provide telehealth services?

Yes, therapy assistants can provide telehealth-supported services when appropriate. This works best for activities like exercise supervision, communication practice, and skill coaching. The supervising therapist must approve telehealth delivery and ensure it's suitable for the participant's needs.
