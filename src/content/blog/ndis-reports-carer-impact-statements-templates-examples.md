# Carer Impact Statement: Free NDIS Template & Examples (2026)

Writing a carer impact statement for NDIS can feel overwhelming. You're exhausted from caring, and now you need to articulate that exhaustion in a way that will convince an NDIS planner to approve more support. Where do you even start?

Many carers struggle with this. They worry about oversharing, underselling their situation, or simply not knowing the "right" way to structure the document. The good news is that there's no single perfect format. What matters is being clear, specific, and honest about how caring affects your life.

This guide gives you everything you need: templates you can use immediately, real examples to guide your writing, and practical advice on what NDIS planners actually look for.

## Key Points: Writing an NDIS Carer Impact Statement

- A **carer impact statement** (also called a carer statement or NDIS carer statement) describes how caring for someone with disability affects your physical health, mental wellbeing, finances, and daily life
- It is **not compulsory** for NDIS applications or plan reviews, but can significantly influence the level of funding approved - up to 30% more funding according to NDIS planners
- NDIS planners look for **specific, measurable impacts** rather than general statements like "it's hard" - include hours of care per week, specific health conditions, and dollar amounts for financial impact
- Include **supporting evidence** such as GP letters, receipts, or psychologist reports to strengthen your statement and demonstrate credibility
- A good carer impact statement is typically **1-2 pages** (500-800 words) with clear headings and bullet points for easy scanning
- **Free downloadable template available:** Download our [Carer Impact Statement Template (DOCX)](/downloads/ndis-carer-impact-statement-template-2026.docx) - fully formatted and ready to fill in

## What is a Carer Impact Statement?

A carer impact statement (also called a carer statement or primary carer statement) is a document that explains the effect of caring for a person with disability on your own life. It's written by you, the carer, in your own words.

The statement helps NDIS planners understand:

- What informal supports you currently provide
- How caring affects your physical and mental health
- The financial impact on your household
- What you can and cannot sustain long-term
- Why formal supports are needed to replace or supplement your care

> **Important:** A carer impact statement is about *your* experience as the carer. It's different from the participant's own impact statement, which focuses on how their disability affects *their* daily life.

### Do You Need a Carer Impact Statement?

A carer impact statement is not mandatory for NDIS applications or plan reviews. However, the [Developmental Disability WA](https://ddwa.org.au/) notes that submitting one "can affect the level of funding received as it will provide a more accurate picture."

Consider writing a carer impact statement if:

- You're applying for NDIS for the first time
- You're requesting a plan review with increased supports
- The person you care for has high support needs
- Your caring role has increased or your circumstances have changed
- You're experiencing burnout, health issues, or financial strain from caring

## Carer Impact Statement Template (Free Download)

> **Download Our Free Template:** We've created a professional carer impact statement template for NDIS with all the sections covered below, formatted and ready to fill in. This template is used by hundreds of carers across Australia to secure increased NDIS funding. [Download Carer Impact Statement Template (DOCX)](/downloads/ndis-carer-impact-statement-template-2026.docx)

Use this structure when writing an NDIS carer statement. You don't need to include every section, but covering the key areas helps NDIS planners understand your full situation and approve appropriate supports.

### Section 1: Your Details

Start with basic information about yourself and your relationship to the NDIS participant.

**Include:**
- Your name and date of birth
- Your relationship to the participant (parent, spouse, sibling, etc.)
- Whether you are the primary or secondary carer
- How long you have been in this caring role
- Your living arrangement (do you live with the participant?)

**Example:**
*"I am Sarah Chen, 45 years old, and the primary carer for my 19-year-old son James who has autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. I have been James's main carer since his diagnosis at age 3. We live together in a three-bedroom home in Western Sydney."*

### Section 2: Daily Caring Tasks

Describe what you do each day and how much time it takes. Be specific about hours, frequency, and the type of assistance required.

**Include:**
- Personal care (bathing, toileting, dressing, feeding)
- Medication management
- Mobility assistance and transfers
- Behaviour support
- Transport to appointments
- Supervision requirements
- Night-time support

**Example:**
*"A typical day involves:*
- *Morning routine (5:30-7:30am): Wake James, supervise showering, assist with dressing, prepare and supervise breakfast, administer morning medication*
- *Throughout day: Constant supervision due to safety risks; James cannot be left alone*
- *Transport: Drive to day program (40 min each way), plus 2-3 medical appointments per week*
- *Evening routine (6:00-9:00pm): Prepare dinner, supervise eating, evening medication, shower supervision, bedtime routine*
- *Night-time: Check on James 2-3 times due to sleep disturbances*

*Total: Approximately 70 hours per week of direct care and supervision."*

### Section 3: Impact on Your Physical Health

Describe any physical health issues that have developed or worsened because of your caring role.

**Include:**
- Specific injuries or conditions (back pain, fatigue, sleep deprivation)
- Medical treatments you've needed
- How caring tasks contribute to these issues
- Any medical advice you've received about reducing physical demands

**Example:**
*"The physical demands of caring have significantly affected my health:*
- *Chronic lower back pain from lifting and transferring James (65kg). My GP has recommended I avoid lifting, but this is impossible without additional support*
- *Averaging 4-5 hours of broken sleep per night for the past 3 years due to James's sleep disturbances*
- *Developed high blood pressure in 2024, which my doctor attributes partly to chronic stress and sleep deprivation"*

### Section 4: Impact on Your Mental Health and Wellbeing

Explain how caring affects you emotionally and psychologically. This is often the hardest section to write, but it's crucial for planners to understand.

**Include:**
- Stress, anxiety, or depression you experience
- Feelings of isolation or loss of identity
- Carer burnout symptoms
- Any mental health support you're receiving
- Worry about the future

**Example:**
*"I experience significant anxiety and stress related to my caring role. I have been seeing a psychologist fortnightly since March 2024 to manage symptoms of burnout. The constant vigilance required for James's safety means I never feel I can truly relax, even when he is at his day program. I worry constantly about what will happen to James when I am no longer able to care for him."*

### Section 5: Impact on Employment and Finances

Detail how caring has affected your work situation and household finances.

**Include:**
- Work hours you've had to reduce or give up
- Income lost
- Career opportunities missed
- Out-of-pocket expenses for caring
- Financial stress

**Example:**
*"Before James's needs increased, I worked full-time as an accountant earning $85,000 per year. I have progressively reduced my hours and now work only 10 hours per week ($21,000 per year). This represents a loss of $64,000 annually. Additionally, we spend approximately $3,000 per year on disability-related expenses not covered by NDIS, including specialised food, replacement of damaged household items, and additional cleaning."*

### Section 6: Impact on Social and Family Life

Describe how caring affects your relationships, social connections, and participation in community activities.

**Include:**
- Reduced social activities and friendships
- Impact on your partner and other children
- Family outings and holidays you've had to forgo
- Community participation you've had to give up

**Example:**
*"My social life has effectively disappeared. I have not seen friends socially in over 12 months because I cannot leave James unsupervised and respite is limited. My 16-year-old daughter has missed school events because I couldn't arrange care for James. Family holidays are impossible. My relationship with my husband is strained as we have no time together without James present."*

### Section 7: What You Need (Support Request)

Clearly state what additional supports you are requesting and how they would help.

**Include:**
- Specific types of support (respite, personal care hours, behaviour support)
- How many hours or how much funding
- How this will reduce the impacts you've described
- How it will help you continue as a sustainable carer

**Example:**
*"I am requesting:*
- *Additional personal care support (20 hours per week) to reduce my physical caring load*
- *Regular respite (one weekend per month) to allow me to rest and spend time with my daughter and husband*
- *Behaviour support specialist to develop strategies that reduce James's night-time disturbances*

*These supports would allow me to continue as James's primary carer without further deterioration of my health. Without them, I am at serious risk of burnout, which would ultimately require far more intensive (and expensive) supports for James."*

## Carer Impact Statement Example: Full Sample

Here is a complete example of a carer impact statement. Use it as a guide, but remember to write in your own words about your own situation.

---

**Carer Impact Statement**

**Date:** 15 December 2025

**Carer Details**
I am Michelle Roberts, 52 years old, and the primary carer for my husband David (58) who has an acquired brain injury following a car accident in 2019. We live together in our family home in Brisbane. I have been David's full-time carer for 6 years.

**Caring Responsibilities**
I provide David with assistance for all personal care activities including showering, dressing, toileting, and grooming. He requires prompting and supervision for all meals. I administer his medications three times daily and manage all his medical appointments (approximately 4-6 per month with neurologist, GP, physiotherapist, and speech pathologist).

David cannot be left alone for more than 30 minutes due to safety risks from his cognitive impairment. He experiences confusion, disorientation, and occasionally becomes agitated, particularly in the late afternoon and evening.

I estimate I provide 80+ hours of care and supervision per week.

**Physical Health Impact**
The physical demands of caring have taken a serious toll:
- Chronic back pain from assisting David with transfers (he weighs 85kg). I now require fortnightly physiotherapy
- Exhaustion from disrupted sleep. David wakes 2-3 times per night and requires reassurance and sometimes personal care
- I have lost 8kg in the past year due to stress and irregular eating patterns
- My GP has expressed concern about my elevated blood pressure and cortisol levels

**Mental Health Impact**
I am exhausted, both physically and emotionally. I feel like I have lost my husband as a partner; he is now fully dependent on me and can no longer provide emotional support. I experience:
- Persistent low mood and anxiety
- Feelings of grief for the life we had planned
- Guilt when I feel frustrated or resentful
- Fear about the future if my own health fails

I have been attending counselling monthly, but this is difficult to maintain due to the challenges of arranging care for David.

**Financial Impact**
I was a senior project manager earning $120,000 per year. I resigned in 2020 to care for David and have been unable to return to work. Our household income has dropped by more than 60%. We have used a significant portion of our retirement savings and have had to take out a mortgage on our previously paid-off home.

Out-of-pocket costs include:
- Continence products: $150/month
- Additional cleaning supplies: $80/month
- Increased electricity (heating, washing): $60/month
- My physiotherapy: $160/month

**Social Impact**
I have become socially isolated. I cannot leave David unattended, and most friends have drifted away. I have not been able to visit my elderly mother interstate since 2021. David and I used to travel regularly; we have not had a holiday in 6 years. Our adult children help when they can, but they have their own families and work commitments.

**What I Am Requesting**
To continue caring for David safely and sustainably, I am requesting:
1. **Additional personal care support** (25 hours per week) to assist with morning and evening routines
2. **Regular respite** (one full week per quarter) to allow me to rest, attend to my own health appointments, and visit family
3. **Behaviour support** to help manage David's evening agitation, which would improve his quality of life and reduce my stress

Without these supports, my own health will continue to deteriorate, and I will not be able to sustain this level of care. A breakdown in my health would result in David requiring residential care, which would be more costly for the NDIS and devastating for our family.

**Supporting Documents Attached:**
- GP letter confirming my health conditions (dated 10 Dec 2025)
- Physiotherapist report
- Psychologist letter
- Financial summary

## What NDIS Planners Look For

NDIS planners review many carer impact statements. Here's what makes yours stand out:

### 1. Specific, Measurable Details

**Weak:** "I spend a lot of time caring for my son."

**Strong:** "I provide approximately 70 hours per week of direct care, including 3 hours of personal care each morning, constant daytime supervision, and 2-3 night-time check-ins."

### 2. Clear Links to NDIS Goals

Show how the carer burden affects the participant's ability to achieve their goals. For example: "The lack of respite means I cannot attend training on positive behaviour support techniques, which limits my ability to help James develop independent living skills."

### 3. Evidence of Sustainability Risk

Planners want to avoid carer breakdown, which leads to crisis situations and costly interventions. Be honest about what you can and cannot continue doing.

**Example:** "My GP has advised that without a reduction in physical caring demands, I am at high risk of a serious back injury that would leave me unable to care for David at all."

### 4. Reasonable and Necessary Connection

Explain how each requested support:
- Relates directly to the participant's disability
- Will reduce the specific impacts you've described
- Represents value for money compared to alternatives

### 5. Supporting Evidence

Attach documentation that backs up your statements:
- GP or specialist letters about your health conditions
- Psychologist or counsellor letters about mental health impacts
- Pay slips or tax returns showing income reduction
- Receipts for out-of-pocket disability-related expenses

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Being Too Vague

| Instead of... | Write... |
|:--------------|:---------|
| "Caring is exhausting" | "I average 4-5 hours of sleep per night due to night-time care needs" |
| "I can't work anymore" | "I reduced my work hours from 38 to 8 per week, losing $52,000 annually" |
| "It's affecting my health" | "I have developed chronic back pain requiring monthly physiotherapy" |

### Focusing Only on Negatives

While you need to explain difficulties, also show:
- Your strengths as a carer
- What's working well
- Your commitment to continuing in the caring role with appropriate support

### Making It Too Long

Planners are busy. A focused 1-2 page statement with clear headings is more effective than a 10-page document that buries key information.

### Forgetting the "Ask"

Always include a specific request for what supports you need and why. Don't leave planners guessing what you want from them.

## Tips From the Community

People who have been through the NDIS process share these insights:

**Keep a log before writing.** Track your caring activities for a week, noting times and durations. This gives you accurate data to include in your statement.

**Don't minimise your situation.** Many carers are so used to their routine that they downplay what they do. A fresh perspective from a friend or support coordinator can help you see the true extent of your caring role.

**Use the participant's NDIS goals.** Frame your needs around how they support the participant's goals in their plan. This aligns your request with NDIS priorities.

**Get someone else to read it.** A fresh pair of eyes can spot gaps, suggest clearer wording, and tell you if the emotional tone is appropriate.

**It doesn't have to be perfect.** A clear, honest statement is more powerful than a polished but vague one. Write in your own voice.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is a carer impact statement the same as a carer statement?

Yes, the terms are used interchangeably. A carer impact statement, carer statement, primary carer statement, and family impact statement all refer to the same document: your account of how caring for someone with disability affects your life. When writing an NDIS carer statement template, all these terms describe the same process.

### Can I submit a carer impact statement for someone else's NDIS plan?

Yes. The carer impact statement is about *you* as the carer, but it's submitted as part of the *participant's* NDIS application or plan review. It provides evidence to support the participant's funding request.

### How often should I update my carer impact statement?

Update your statement whenever:
- The participant has a plan review
- Your circumstances change significantly
- The participant's needs increase
- Your own health or situation changes

### Do I need a separate statement for each plan review?

It's best to write a fresh statement for each review rather than resubmitting an old one. This shows current, relevant information and demonstrates ongoing impact.

### What if I find it too emotional to write?

This is common. Many carers find the process brings up difficult feelings. Consider:
- Writing in short sessions rather than all at once
- Asking a trusted friend or support coordinator to help
- Using dot points first, then adding sentences later
- Speaking your thoughts into a voice recorder and transcribing

### Should I include information about other carers?

If multiple people share caring responsibilities, you can each write a separate statement, or you can mention shared care arrangements in your statement with an estimate of what each person contributes.

### What if I'm not the primary carer?

Secondary carers can also write impact statements. Focus on your specific caring contributions and how they affect your life, even if you're not providing the majority of care.

### How do I write a carer impact statement for NDIS?

To write an effective NDIS carer impact statement:
1. Download our free carer statement template (link above)
2. Include specific, measurable details (hours of care, dollar amounts, specific health conditions)
3. Cover all key areas: daily tasks, physical health impact, mental health impact, financial impact, and social impact
4. State clearly what supports you're requesting and why
5. Attach supporting evidence (GP letters, receipts, psychologist reports)
6. Keep it focused (1-2 pages) with clear headings

### What is a carer statement template?

A carer statement template is a pre-formatted document that provides the structure and sections you need when writing an NDIS carer impact statement. Our free template includes all recommended sections, example wording, and prompts to help you describe your caring situation comprehensively. Using a template ensures you don't miss important information that NDIS planners need to see.

### Can I use the same carer impact statement for multiple NDIS reviews?

No, it's best to write a fresh carer impact statement for each NDIS plan review. Your circumstances change over time - the person's needs may have increased, your own health may have declined, or your financial situation may have worsened. A current statement dated within the last 3 months carries more weight with planners than an outdated document.
