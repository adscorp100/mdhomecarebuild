# The CareSide

Australia's Best Value for Home Care. The CareSide delivers the highest quality care at the industry's most affordable prices.

## About This Provider

The CareSide is a family-owned and operated home care provider established in 2017, delivering services across Australia. We provide services for self-managed and fully managed care recipients while maximising Home Care Package or CHSP funds.

When you entrust us with your care, you'll get the same caregiver every time, precisely at the times you choose, with no locked-in contract or hidden fees. Our clients receive on average 25% more hours of care compared to other providers.

We directly employ and train all of our caregivers, and we do not outsource or subcontract through other agencies—so you will never encounter strangers on your doorstep.

### Family Owned and Operated

### Continuity of Care
Our clients get the same caregiver every visit. It's not just about getting tasks done—it's about developing a relationship.

### Trained and Qualified Staff
Our care teams are more than just helpers who can pass background checks. They are trained on how to support older individuals with different needs. Many hold advanced degrees and specialised licenses.
