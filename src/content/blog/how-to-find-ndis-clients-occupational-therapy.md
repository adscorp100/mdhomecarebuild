## The NDIS Occupational Therapy Opportunity in 2026

The NDIS occupational therapy market has reached maturity with over **450,000 active participants** eligible for OT services under Improved Daily Living and Capacity Building support categories.

**Market Size for NDIS OT:**
- **$2.8 billion** allocated to allied health annually
- **65%** of NDIS participants have OT funding in their plans
- **Average OT allocation:** $8,000-$15,000 per participant per year
- **Growing demand areas:** Assistive technology assessments, home modification reports, functional capacity assessments

**The Challenge:** While demand is high, occupational therapists consistently report that **finding and converting NDIS clients is their #1 business challenge**. The NDIS marketplace is saturated with OT providers, but most struggle with client acquisition because they rely solely on the NDIS Provider Finder or generic Google ads.

**The Solution:** Strategic partnerships with disability service providers who already have established participant relationships.

## Why Most OTs Struggle to Find NDIS Clients

**Common mistakes occupational therapists make:**

1. **Relying only on the NDIS Provider Finder** - Low conversion rate (2-5% of inquiries convert)
2. **Generic Google Ads** - Expensive ($15-$40 per click) and low intent
3. **Solo practice isolation** - No referral network or partnerships
4. **Waiting for participant inquiries** - Passive approach in competitive market
5. **No support coordinator relationships** - Missing the gatekeepers who control budgets
6. **Unclear service differentiation** - "General OT services" doesn't stand out

**The Reality:** NDIS participants don't search for "occupational therapist near me" - they ask their **support coordinators** who to use, or they find providers through **trusted disability service organizations** they're already working with.

This is why provider network partnerships (Channel #1 below) deliver clients 3x faster than solo marketing.

## 7 Proven Client Acquisition Channels for NDIS Occupational Therapists

### 1. Provider Network Partnerships (Fastest ROI)

**How it works:** Partner with established NDIS providers like MD Home Care who already serve participants needing OT assessments and therapy. When participants require occupational therapy services, you're recommended as the preferred provider.

**MD Home Care Allied Health Network Benefits:**
- **Direct participant referrals** - Participants already receiving support services who need OT
- **Support coordination referrals** - Our SCs recommend network OTs to their participants
- **Clinical coordination** - Our RNs identify OT needs during care plan reviews
- **Administrative support** - We handle NDIS plan management, invoicing coordination, and participant liaison
- **Guaranteed payment** - Work with plan-managed and agency-managed participants (no chasing invoices)

**Expected Timeline:**
- **Application to first referral:** 2-4 weeks
- **Average referrals per month:** 3-8 participants (depending on availability and specialization)
- **Referral quality:** High (participants already engaged, funding confirmed)

**Requirements to Join MD Home Care Network:**
- NDIS registered occupational therapist
- Professional indemnity and public liability insurance
- AHPRA registration current
- NDIS Worker Screening Check
- Availability for participants in Sydney or Melbourne

**Case Study - Sarah Chen, OT (Western Sydney):**

*"I spent 6 months trying to build my NDIS OT practice through Google Ads and the NDIS Finder with minimal success - maybe 1-2 inquiries per month and low conversion. I joined MD Home Care's allied health network in August 2025, and within 3 weeks I received my first 2 referrals. Six months later, I'm consistently getting 5-6 new participant referrals per month. The quality is exceptional because participants already trust MD Home Care, so they trust me as their recommended OT. My practice went from struggling to sustainable in under 6 months."*

### 2. Support Coordinator Partnerships (High-Value Referrals)

**Why this works:** Support coordinators are the gatekeepers of NDIS participant budgets. They recommend allied health providers to their participants and often coordinate service bookings. A single SC managing 20-30 participants can generate 5-10 OT referrals per year.

**How to build SC relationships:**

**Step 1: Identify active support coordinators in your area**
- Search LinkedIn for "Support Coordinator [your suburb]"
- Check NDIS Provider Finder for SC providers
- Attend NDIS industry events and networking sessions
- Join local NDIS provider Facebook groups

**Step 2: Create a professional SC referral packet**
- One-page OT services overview (specializations, typical participants served)
- NDIS pricing transparency (your rates, bulk billing options)
- Turnaround times for common assessments (FCA: 2 weeks, AT report: 10 days, etc.)
- Sample reports (redacted) showing quality of work
- Referral process (how SCs can refer participants to you)

**Step 3: Offer SC-specific value**
- **Fast turnaround** - Commit to 48-hour initial assessment scheduling
- **Clear communication** - Update SCs on participant progress
- **Comprehensive reports** - SCs need detailed reports for plan reviews
- **Flexible availability** - Offer after-hours or weekend appointments

**Step 4: Stay top-of-mind**
- Monthly email with NDIS updates (price guide changes, new support categories)
- Quarterly "coffee catchup" to discuss participant needs
- Share success stories (with permission)
- Offer to co-present at SC professional development sessions

**Expected Timeline:**
- **3-6 months** to build 5-10 strong SC relationships
- **1-2 referrals per SC per quarter** (varies by SC caseload)

**Pro Tip:** Support coordinators often refer to providers found through MD Home Care because participants can find multiple services in one place. When you create your profile on MD Home Care, you become visible to SCs who regularly use the platform for referrals.

### 3. NDIS Provider Finder Optimization (Passive Lead Generation)

**The NDIS Provider Finder is the official directory where participants search for providers.** While conversion rates are lower than referral partnerships, it's free and generates passive inquiries.

**Optimization Checklist:**

**Profile Completeness:**
- [ ] Business name clearly indicates OT specialization
- [ ] Service descriptions mention specific participant needs (autism, stroke recovery, spinal injury, etc.)
- [ ] Location coverage lists all suburbs you serve (the more, the better)
- [ ] Contact methods include phone, email, and website
- [ ] Languages spoken if bilingual/multilingual
- [ ] Operating hours clearly stated

**Service Category Selection:**
- [ ] Therapeutic Supports - Occupational Therapy
- [ ] Assistance with Daily Life - Assistive Technology Assessment
- [ ] Capacity Building - Life Skills Development
- [ ] Home Modifications - OT Assessment and Prescription

**Specialization Keywords:**
- Autism spectrum disorder OT
- Stroke and acquired brain injury rehabilitation
- Spinal cord injury OT
- Assistive technology specialist
- Home modification assessment
- Functional capacity assessment (FCA)
- Pediatric OT / adult OT (specify your age groups)

**Response Time:**
- Reply to Finder inquiries within **2 hours** (participants contact 3-5 providers, first responder often wins)
- Use templated responses for common questions (pricing, availability, process)
- Offer phone call within 24 hours to discuss participant needs

**Expected Results:**
- **3-8 inquiries per month** (depends on location and specialization)
- **20-30% conversion rate** (if you respond fast and have availability)

---

### 4. Local Area Coordinator (LAC) Relationships

**LACs help NDIS participants access the scheme and connect with providers.** Unlike support coordinators (who are funded in participant plans), LACs are NDIA employees who assist participants before and during planning meetings.

**Why LACs matter:**
- LACs recommend providers during plan development
- LACs identify participants needing allied health (including OT) during planning conversations
- LACs operate regionally, so building relationships with 2-3 LACs in your area creates consistent referral flow

**How to connect with LACs:**

**Step 1: Identify your area's LAC partner organization**
- NDIS website lists LAC partner organizations by region
- Common LAC organizations: APM, Leap in!, Community Lifestyle Assistance, MiLife

**Step 2: Reach out professionally**
- Email LAC team leads: "I'm a registered NDIS OT in [suburb] looking to support participants in your area. Can I share my services overview with your team?"
- Attend LAC community information sessions (they host these monthly in most regions)

**Step 3: Provide value to LACs**
- Offer free "Understanding OT in the NDIS" workshops for participants
- Create one-page participant guides (e.g., "When Do I Need an OT Assessment?")
- Be responsive and reliable when LACs refer participants

**Expected Timeline:**
- **2-4 months** to establish LAC relationships
- **1-3 referrals per quarter** per LAC relationship

---

### 5. Participant Advocacy Groups and Community Organizations

**Disability advocacy groups and community organizations** have trusted relationships with NDIS participants and their families. Partnering with these organizations positions you as a community-connected provider.

**Target Organizations:**
- **Autism-specific:** Autism Spectrum Australia (Aspect), Amaze
- **Physical disability:** Physical Disability Council of Australia, Spinal Cord Injuries Australia
- **Acquired brain injury:** Brain Injury Australia, Synapse
- **Multicultural disability:** CALD Assist, multicultural disability advocacy services
- **Pediatric:** Early Childhood Intervention Australia (ECIA)

**Partnership Strategies:**

**1. Educational Workshops**
- Offer free workshops: "Understanding OT for NDIS Participants" or "Assistive Technology: What's Funded and How to Access It"
- Organizations love free education for their members
- Generates direct participant inquiries + builds credibility

**2. Resource Contributions**
- Write blog posts or guides for organization websites
- Create downloadable resources (e.g., "OT Checklist for NDIS Planning Meetings")
- Volunteer for their advisory committees or working groups

**3. Preferred Provider Listings**
- Many organizations maintain recommended provider directories
- Application process varies, but inclusion generates inquiries

**Expected Results:**
- **2-5 inquiries per quarter** per organization partnership
- **High participant engagement** (organization members are active in NDIS)

---

### 6. Online Presence and Content Marketing

**Strategic content marketing positions you as an expert and generates organic Google traffic** from participants researching OT services.

**Content Strategy for OT NDIS Marketing:**

**Blog Topics to Target:**
- "What Does an NDIS Occupational Therapist Do? [2026 Guide]"
- "How to Get OT Funding in Your NDIS Plan"
- "NDIS Functional Capacity Assessment: What to Expect"
- "Assistive Technology for [Specific Disability]: OT Recommendations"
- "Home Modifications Under NDIS: The OT Assessment Process"

**SEO Keywords to Target:**
- "NDIS occupational therapist [your suburb]"
- "NDIS OT assessment [your region]"
- "Assistive technology assessment NDIS"
- "Functional capacity assessment OT"
- "NDIS home modification assessment"

**Google Business Profile Optimization:**
- Category: "Occupational Therapist" + "Disability Services"
- Services: List specific OT assessment types
- Photos: Office, therapy equipment, team photos
- Reviews: Request reviews from participants (with permission)
- Posts: Weekly updates about NDIS OT services

**Expected Timeline:**
- **3-6 months** to see Google ranking improvements
- **5-15 inquiries per month** once content ranks (varies by competition)

---

### 7. NDIS Plan Management Companies

**Plan managers handle NDIS invoicing and payments for participants.** Building relationships with plan management companies creates referral opportunities because they interact with participants regularly about service providers.

**Why plan managers refer:**
- Participants ask plan managers for provider recommendations
- Plan managers prefer reliable providers who invoice correctly (reduces their admin)
- Plan managers want participants to use their full funding (good for retention)

**How to Partner with Plan Managers:**

**Step 1: Identify local plan managers**
- NDIS Provider Finder (search for "Plan Management" in your region)
- Major plan managers: Leap in!, Plan Partners, Plan Management People, My Plan Manager

**Step 2: Demonstrate reliability**
- Invoice correctly (proper NDIS line items, clear service descriptions)
- Fast turnaround on participant requests
- Communicate clearly about participant progress
- Follow up professionally on payment queries

**Step 3: Stay connected**
- Quarterly email updates about your OT services
- Offer to present at plan manager team meetings
- Share NDIS OT updates that affect invoicing (price guide changes, new line items)

**Expected Results:**
- **2-4 referrals per quarter** per plan manager relationship
- **Higher quality referrals** (participants already have plan management sorted)

## Case Study: From Solo Practice to Sustainable OT Business

**Provider:** Lisa Martinez, Occupational Therapist (Melbourne South East)
**Background:** Newly registered NDIS provider, 8 years OT experience
**Challenge:** Building NDIS client base from zero

**Timeline:**

**Month 1-3 (Solo Marketing)**
- Optimized NDIS Provider Finder profile
- Ran Google Ads ($800/month budget)
- Created Facebook business page
- **Result:** 4 inquiries, 1 converted client

**Month 4 (Joined MD Home Care Allied Health Network)**
- Applied to MD Home Care network
- Completed onboarding (background checks, insurance verification)
- Introduced to 3 support coordinators working with MD Home Care
- **Result:** First 2 referrals within 3 weeks

**Month 4-6 (Building SC Relationships)**
- Developed referral packets for support coordinators
- Attended 2 NDIS networking events
- Built relationships with 5 support coordinators
- **Result:** Steady 3-4 referrals per month

**Month 7-12 (Established Practice)**
- Referrals from MD Home Care network: 2-3/month
- Referrals from SC relationships: 2-3/month
- NDIS Finder inquiries: 1-2/month
- **Result:** Sustainable practice with 6-8 new clients monthly

**Current State (18 months):**
- **Active caseload:** 25-30 participants
- **Monthly revenue:** $18,000-$24,000
- **Client acquisition cost:** $0 (network referrals) vs $400 per client (Google Ads)
- **Time to full capacity:** 18 months

**Lisa's Advice:**

*"I wasted 3 months and $2,400 on Google Ads before I realized NDIS participants don't search for OTs on Google - they ask their support coordinators or use providers their disability service recommends. Joining MD Home Care's network gave me instant access to participants who already trusted the MD Home Care network, which made converting referrals so much easier. Combined with building my own SC relationships, I had a full practice within 18 months. My only regret is not joining the network sooner."*

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to get my first NDIS OT client?

**Timeline varies by acquisition channel:**

- **Provider network (MD Home Care):** 2-4 weeks after onboarding
- **Support coordinator referrals:** 1-3 months to build relationships, then ongoing
- **NDIS Provider Finder:** 2-6 weeks for first inquiry (conversion depends on response time)
- **Google/Content marketing:** 3-6 months to see results
- **Advocacy group partnerships:** 1-3 months

**Fastest path:** Join a provider network like MD Home Care while simultaneously building support coordinator relationships. This dual approach typically delivers first clients within 4-6 weeks.

### How much does it cost to join MD Home Care Allied Health Network?

**No upfront fees or membership costs.** MD Home Care charges no fees to occupational therapists in our network. You bill participants directly through their NDIS plans at NDIS Price Guide rates and retain 100% of your professional fees.

**What we ask in return:**
- Professional service delivery to our participants
- Communication and coordination with our care teams
- Adherence to NDIS compliance and quality standards

This is a referral partnership, not a franchise or fee-for-service arrangement.

### Can I work with multiple provider networks or do I need to be exclusive to MD Home Care?

**Non-exclusive partnership.** MD Home Care allied health network membership does not require exclusivity. You can:
- Work with other NDIS providers and referral networks
- Accept direct participant inquiries
- Build your own support coordinator relationships
- Market your services independently

**The only expectation:** When you receive MD Home Care referrals, provide the same professional service quality you would with any participant.

### What if I'm not NDIS registered as a sole provider - can I still join the network?

**Yes, with conditions.** If you're not a registered NDIS provider, you can still join MD Home Care's network and work with:
- **Plan-managed participants** (no provider registration required)
- **Self-managed participants** (no provider registration required)

You **cannot** work with agency-managed participants unless you're NDIS registered. However, approximately 70% of MD Home Care participants are plan-managed or self-managed, so you'll still receive referrals.

**We recommend:** Start the NDIS registration process while working with plan/self-managed participants. Registration typically takes 3-6 months.

### How many referrals can I expect per month from MD Home Care?

**Typical referral volume:** 3-8 participants per month, depending on:

**Your availability:**
- 10-15 hours/week available: 3-4 referrals/month
- 20+ hours/week available: 5-8 referrals/month

**Your specialization:**
- High-demand areas (pediatric autism OT, AT assessments): 5-8 referrals/month
- General OT: 3-5 referrals/month

**Your region:**
- Sydney Western suburbs: Higher volume (our largest participant base)
- Melbourne South East: Moderate to high volume
- Other regions: Moderate volume

**Important:** Referrals are not guaranteed and fluctuate based on participant needs. However, MD Home Care's 500+ active participant base ensures consistent referral flow for network providers.

### Do I need to be in Sydney or Melbourne, or can I join from regional areas?

**Currently Sydney and Melbourne metro only.** MD Home Care's participant base is concentrated in:
- **Sydney:** Western Sydney (Parramatta, Blacktown, Liverpool), South West (Campbelltown, Bankstown), North Shore, Eastern Suburbs
- **Melbourne:** South East (Dandenong, Casey), North West (Hume, Brimbank), East (Whitehorse, Monash)

**Regional expansion planned:** We're expanding to Newcastle, Wollongong, and Geelong in 2026. Email [providers@mdhomecare.com.au](mailto:providers@mdhomecare.com.au) to express interest for future regional networks.

### What's the difference between working with MD Home Care vs other NDIS providers?

**MD Home Care Advantages:**

**1. Integrated care model:**
- Our participants already receive support services (SIL, community access, personal care)
- You're integrated into existing care teams, not working in isolation
- Clinical coordination with RNs who identify OT needs during care reviews

**2. Support coordinator relationships:**
- MD Home Care works with 50+ independent support coordinators
- Network OTs get introduced to these SCs (referral multiplication)
- Ongoing referrals beyond just MD Home Care participants

**3. Quality over volume:**
- We vet participant referrals before sending to you (funding confirmed, clear OT goals)
- No "spray and pray" referrals that waste your time
- Participants are engaged and motivated (already working with our care teams)

**4. Professional development:**
- Quarterly allied health network meetings (learn from other OTs, physios, speech pathologists)
- NDIS training and updates
- Clinical case discussions for complex participants

**Other provider networks** may offer higher referral volume but less integration, support, or quality control.
