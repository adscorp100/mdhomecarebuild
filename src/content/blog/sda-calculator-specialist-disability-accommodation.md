## SDA Funding Calculator 2026

Use this table to calculate your maximum annual SDA funding based on your specific situation.

### Step 1: Identify Your Design Category

| Design Category | Who It's For | Typical Features |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Improved Liveability** | Sensory, intellectual or cognitive impairments | Enhanced lighting, wayfinding, level surfaces |
| **Fully Accessible** | Physical/mobility impairments, wheelchair users | Zero-step entry, wide doorways, accessible bathrooms |
| **Robust** | Behavioural support needs | Impact-resistant materials, secure fittings |

| **Regional (MMM4-5)** | Newcastle, Geelong, Cairns | +5-10% |
| **Remote (MMM6-7)** | Outback communities, remote areas | +15-25% |

*Use [Health Workforce Locator](https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/rural-health-workforce/classifications/mmm) to find your exact MMM classification.*

### Step 3: Calculate Maximum Annual Funding

**2026-26 SDA Price Limits (Maximum Annual Funding per Participant)**

| Design Category | Apartment (1-bed) | Apartment (2-bed) | Villa (1-bed) | Villa (2-bed) | Group Home |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| **Improved Liveability** | $42,847 | $49,275 | $46,355 | $52,560 | $35,040/bed |

## SDA Eligibility Requirements

SDA funding is available to NDIS participants who meet specific eligibility criteria. Not all participants qualify - SDA is designed for those with the highest support needs.

### Basic Eligibility Criteria

| Requirement | What It Means |
|-------------|---------------|
| **NDIS participant** | You must have an approved NDIS plan |
| **Extreme functional impairment** | Your disability significantly impacts your ability to live in standard housing |
| **Specialist housing needed** | Your support needs cannot be met in ordinary housing, even with modifications |
| **Long-term need** | You're expected to need SDA for at least 12 months |
| **Support delivery** | Your high-level supports can only be effectively delivered in specialist housing |

### What "Extreme Functional Impairment" Means

The NDIS assesses functional impairment across these domains:

| Domain | What They Assess |
|--------|------------------|
| **Mobility** | Ability to move around the home safely |
| **Self-care** | Showering, dressing, toileting independently |
| **Communication** | Understanding and being understood |
| **Social interaction** | Managing relationships and daily interactions |
| **Learning** | Understanding information and making decisions |
| **Self-management** | Managing daily activities and routines |

**You may be eligible if you:**
- Need 24-hour support or frequent overnight support
- Require ceiling hoists or other permanent equipment
- Have behaviours that require a robust living environment
- Cannot safely evacuate standard housing in an emergency
- Need environmental modifications that cannot be retrofitted

### Who Does NOT Qualify for SDA

SDA is **not** for participants who:
- Only need minor home modifications (e.g., grab rails, ramps)
- Can live safely in standard housing with support worker assistance
- Only need SIL (Supported Independent Living) funding without specialist housing
- Have support needs that can be met through assistive technology alone
- Are primarily seeking affordable housing (SDA is not social housing)

> **Important:** SDA eligibility is separate from SIL eligibility. Many participants receive SIL without SDA, and some receive SDA without SIL.

## How to Apply for SDA Funding

Getting SDA in your NDIS plan requires evidence and a structured application process.

### Step-by-Step Application Process

#### Step 1: Get a Specialist Assessment (4-8 weeks)

You'll need an assessment from a qualified professional, typically:
- Occupational Therapist (most common)
- Physiotherapist
- SDA-qualified assessor

**The assessment should document:**
- Your current living situation and why it's unsuitable
- Your functional capacity across all domains
- Why SDA is necessary (not just beneficial)
- Which design category best meets your needs
- Evidence that your needs cannot be met in standard housing

**Cost:** Funded under Capacity Building - Improved Daily Living (approximately $193-$300/hour)

#### Step 2: Submit Plan Amendment Request (1-2 weeks)

Work with your:
- Local Area Coordinator (LAC), or
- Support Coordinator, or
- Plan Manager

Submit the assessment report with a formal request to add SDA funding to your plan.

**Include:**
- Completed SDA assessment report
- Supporting medical documentation
- Current housing situation details
- Your preferred design category and building type

#### Step 3: NDIS Decision (6-12 weeks)

The NDIA will review your application and may:
- Approve SDA funding at your requested level
- Approve a different design category
- Request additional information
- Decline the request (with reasons provided)

**If approved:** Your plan will include an SDA funding line with the maximum annual amount.

#### Step 4: Find an SDA Property (Varies - weeks to months)

Once approved, search for available SDA properties that match your:
- Design category
- Location preferences
- Building type preferences
- Budget (within your funding amount)

#### Step 5: Sign Tenancy Agreement

Review and sign a lease with the SDA provider. Ensure you understand:
- Rent amount (must be within your funding cap)
- What's included (utilities, internet, etc.)
- Maintenance responsibilities
- Notice periods

### Application Timeline Summary

| Stage | Typical Duration |
|-------|------------------|
| Assessment booking | 2-4 weeks |
| Assessment completion | 4-8 weeks |
| Plan amendment submission | 1-2 weeks |
| NDIS decision | 6-12 weeks |
| Property search | 2-12+ months |
| **Total** | **4-18+ months** |

## SDA vs SIL: Understanding the Difference

Many participants confuse SDA with SIL. Here's a clear breakdown:

| Aspect | SDA (Specialist Disability Accommodation) | SIL (Supported Independent Living) |
|--------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **What it funds** | The physical building/housing | Support workers to help you live |
| **Purpose** | Specialist housing design features | Personal care and daily living assistance |
| **Payment goes to** | Property owner/developer | Support provider organisation |
| **Eligibility** | Extreme functional impairment requiring specialist housing | Need for regular support to live independently |
| **Can have both?** | Yes - many participants have both | Yes - many participants have both |
| **Average funding** | $15,000 - $117,000/year | $150,000 - $500,000+/year |

**Example:** A participant with spinal cord injury might receive:
- **SDA funding:** $94,170/year for a High Physical Support apartment
- **SIL funding:** $300,000/year for 24/7 support workers

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much SDA funding can I get?

SDA funding ranges from approximately $35,000 to $117,000 per year depending on your design category (Improved Liveability, Fully Accessible, Robust, or High Physical Support), building type, and location. The NDIS sets maximum price limits that providers cannot exceed.

### Do I have to pay rent if I have SDA funding?

Yes, participants pay a reasonable rent contribution of approximately 25% of the Disability Support Pension - about $247 per week or $12,856 per year in 2026. This amount is deducted from your SDA funding.

### Can I choose where I live with SDA?

Yes, you can choose any SDA property that matches your approved design category and fits within your funding amount. However, availability is limited and you may need to join waiting lists for preferred locations.

### What's the difference between SDA and public housing?

SDA is purpose-built housing with specific accessibility and support features funded through the NDIS. Public housing is general affordable housing provided by state governments. You cannot combine SDA funding with public housing, though you may be eligible for both programs separately.

### Can I get SDA funding to modify my own home?

No, SDA funding is for purpose-built specialist accommodation. If you want to modify your existing home, you may be eligible for Home Modifications funding under your NDIS Capital Supports budget instead.

### How long does it take to get SDA approved?

The full process typically takes 4-18 months from initial assessment to moving into a property. The NDIS decision usually takes 6-12 weeks after submitting your application, but finding an available property can take significantly longer.

### What if my needs change after I move into SDA?

If your needs decrease, you may transition to lower-category SDA or standard housing while retaining other NDIS supports. If your needs increase, you can apply for higher-category SDA funding through a plan review.

### Are utilities included in SDA funding?

Basic SDA funding covers rent only. Some providers offer utility packages (electricity, water, internet) for an additional fee. Check with your provider what's included and what you'll pay separately.

### Can I have visitors or family stay overnight in SDA?

Yes, SDA is your home and you have the same tenancy rights as any renter. Most SDA properties have space for overnight guests, especially 2-bedroom options.

### What happens to my SDA funding if the provider goes out of business?

Your SDA funding remains in your plan regardless of provider status. If your provider closes, you would need to find alternative SDA accommodation, and the NDIS can help facilitate this transition.
