## Support at Home Prices 2025: Your Guide to Understanding Indicative Costs

The Australian aged care landscape is changing. From 1 July 2025, the new Support at Home program will begin replacing the existing Home Care Packages (HCP) Program and the Short-Term Restorative Care (STRC) Programme. If you or a loved one receive in-home care, understanding the potential costs under this new system is crucial.

Recently, the government released a summary of indicative prices for various Support at Home services, based on a survey of current HCP providers conducted in February 2025 and published on 24 March 2025.

What does "indicative" mean? These are not fixed prices, price caps, or official recommendations. They are estimates showing the range of prices providers expect to charge when the program starts. Think of them as a market guide to help you compare.

This guide breaks down these indicative prices, explains what to expect next, and empowers you to make informed decisions about your care.

### Key Information at a Glance

- **Program Start Date**: 1 July 2025
- **What's Changing**: Support at Home replaces HCP & STRC
- **Prices**: Providers set their own prices (price caps may apply from 1 July 2026, according to recent government updates)
- **Source**: Government survey of over 300 HCP providers (published March 2025)

## What Are Indicative Prices and How Should I Use Them?

The indicative price ranges published by the government provide a snapshot of the market before the Support at Home program officially launches. They show the national median price (the middle point where half of surveyed providers charged less, and half charged more) and a price range (lower and upper bounds) reported by the majority of surveyed providers.

Use this information to:

- **Assess Your Current Provider's Pricing**: Compare the prices your provider proposes for Support at Home with these indicative ranges
- **Compare Potential New Providers**: If you're considering switching, use these ranges as a benchmark
- **Budget and Plan**: Get a general idea of potential service costs (remembering individual co-contributions are separate)

### Important Notes

- These are national averages; prices in your specific area (metro, regional, rural) might differ
- Prices shown are typically for standard business hours. Services outside these hours (evenings, weekends, public holidays) may cost more
- The list below isn't exhaustive â€“ it only includes services where enough data was gathered in the survey
- Most prices are per hour, but Transport is per trip, and Meal Delivery is per meal

## What Happens Next? Your Service Agreement

Before 1 July 2025, your current HCP provider should contact you to:

- Explain any changes to their pricing under the new Support at Home program
- Provide a new Service Agreement outlining the specific services they will deliver and the price for each

Crucially, you need to agree to and sign this Service Agreement to receive services under Support at Home from 1 July 2025.

Don't feel pressured to sign immediately if you're unsure or unhappy. You have the right to understand the prices and the services offered.

## Understanding Co-Contributions

The prices listed below are what providers intend to charge for the service delivery. What you personally pay (your co-contribution) is different and depends on:

- The type of service
- Your means assessment status (income and assets)

Good news: No one will pay co-contributions for clinical care services (like nursing).

The government has indicated a calculator will be published soon to help you estimate your specific co-contributions.

## What if My Provider's Prices Seem High?

A price outside the indicative range doesn't automatically mean it's unreasonable. However, if you feel a proposed price is high, talk to your provider. Ask them to explain:

- Exactly what the service includes for that price
- Why their price might be higher than the indicative range
- If the new pricing means you'll receive fewer service hours compared to your current HCP

Remember, the government has consumer protections in place to ensure prices are reasonable and transparent.

## Can I Change Providers?

Yes. You absolutely have the right to change providers if you are unhappy with their proposed prices, the quality of service, or for any other reason. You can change providers before or after the 1 July 2025 start date.

Key points about changing providers:

- **No Exit Fees**: Providers are not allowed to charge you an exit fee
- **Ensure Continuous Care**: Before finalising an end date with your current provider, confirm a start date with your new provider to avoid gaps in your care
- **My Aged Care**: You'll likely need to contact My Aged Care (1800 200 422) to reactivate your referral code for the new provider
- **Unspent Funds**: Any unspent funds in your package budget should be transferred to your new provider

## Staying Informed

The transition to Support at Home involves significant changes. By understanding these indicative prices and your rights, you can navigate the process more confidently.

- Review the indicative prices
- Wait for your provider to discuss their specific Support at Home pricing and provide a new Service Agreement
- Ask questions if anything is unclear or seems unreasonable
- Know your right to compare and change providers if needed

Stay tuned for more updates, including the co-contribution calculator, as we get closer to the 1 July 2025 launch of Support at Home.
