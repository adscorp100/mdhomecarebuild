Becoming an independent NDIS support worker offers incredible flexibility, higher earning potential, and the chance to run your own business. As of February 2026, working independently means you can set your own rates, choose your clients, and build meaningful one-on-one relationships with NDIS participants.

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about becoming an independent support worker in Australia, including ABN registration, insurance requirements, current pay rates, finding clients through platforms like Mable and Hireup, and managing your tax obligations.

## Quick Answer: How to Become an Independent Support Worker

**What do you need to become an independent NDIS support worker?** You need an ABN, NDIS Worker Screening Check, public liability insurance ($20 million minimum), professional indemnity insurance, and relevant qualifications (Certificate III recommended).

**How much can independent support workers earn?** Typically $60-$70 per hour for standard weekday support in 2026, compared to $32-$48 for agency employees. Independent workers keep more but cover their own insurance, super, and business costs.

**Do independent support workers need NDIS registration?** Individual support workers don't need to register with the NDIS. Only service providers need registration. However, you must be screened and can work with plan-managed or self-managed participants.

## What Does "Independent NDIS Support Worker" Mean?

In the NDIS context, terms like **Independent Support Worker**, **Sole Trader**, and **Contractor** often overlap:

- **Independent Support Worker**: Delivers services outside direct employment with a larger provider
- **Sole Trader**: A business structure where you run your own enterprise and are personally liable for it
- **Contractor**: The nature of your engagement. You are contracted to perform specific services, issuing invoices rather than receiving a salary

Most independent support workers operate as sole traders and contractors. Independence exists on a spectrum - some manage every aspect of their business, while others use online platforms (e.g., Mable, Hireup) that connect them to participants and provide administrative support.

## NDIS Independent Support Worker Pay Rates 2026

One of the biggest advantages of working independently is the potential for higher earnings. Here are the typical pay rates for independent NDIS support workers in 2026:

### Standard Support Worker Rates

- Set aside at least **25-30% of your income** for tax and super obligations

For detailed information about current rates, see our [NDIS Support Worker Hourly Rate 2026](/blog/ndis-support-worker-hourly-rate/) guide.

## Sole Trader vs. Agency Employee: Which is Right for You?

Before you start, it's important to understand the key differences:

| Feature | Independent / Sole Trader | Agency Employee |
|:--------|:--------------------------|:----------------|
| **Pay Rate** | You set your own rates (typically 15-25% higher) | Set by the agency (typically lower) |
| **Flexibility** | High: you choose your hours, clients, and services | Low: the agency manages your schedule |
| **Admin** | You are responsible for tax, super, insurance, etc. | The agency handles all admin |
| **Client Choice** | You find and choose your own clients | The agency assigns clients to you |
| **Security** | Less stable, income depends on your client base | More stable, with consistent work |
| **Leave Entitlements** | No paid leave | Paid annual/sick leave |
| **Insurance** | You arrange own PL, PI, etc. | Employer covers insurance |
| **Superannuation** | You manage your own | Employer pays Super Guarantee |

**The Bottom Line:** Being an independent worker offers higher earning potential and flexibility but comes with greater responsibility. It's particularly well-suited to those who value autonomy, have strong organizational skills, and enjoy building direct relationships with clients.

## Are You an Employee or Independent Contractor?

Misclassifying an employee as a contractor ("sham contracting") carries serious legal, tax, and insurance penalties. Both the ATO and Fair Work Commission assess multiple factors:

- **Control**: Who dictates how, when, and where the work is performed?
- **Integration**: Are you part of the engaging business, or a separate enterprise?
- **Delegation**: Can you delegate work or must you perform it personally?
- **Basis of Payment**: Do you receive wages or issue invoices for completed tasks?
- **Equipment**: Do you use your own tools or does the business supply them?
- **Commercial Risk**: Do you bear profit/loss risk and fix defects at your own cost?
- **Expectation of Work**: Is the engagement ongoing or for a defined project?

Since 26 August 2024, the "Whole of Relationship" test requires examining both written terms and actual working arrangements to assess independence.

## Your Complete Checklist to Get Started

Follow these steps to set up your business as an independent NDIS support worker.

### Step 1: Get Your Qualifications & Checks

| Check Type | Purpose | Validity | Application |
|:-----------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| **NDIS Worker Screening Check** | National risk assessment for NDIS roles | 5 years | Service NSW, Service Victoria, QLD Worker Screening |
| **National Police Check** | Verifies criminal history | Varies | Accredited bodies or state police |
| **Working With Children Check** | If supporting participants under 18 | Varies | State-specific portals |
| **First Aid & CPR Certificate** | Essential for client safety | 3 years (First Aid), 1 year (CPR) | Various providers |

**Recommended Qualifications:**
- **Certificate III in Individual Support (Disability)**: While not legally required for all services, this is the industry standard and highly recommended
- **Valid Driver's License**: Necessary if you plan to offer transport services
- **NDIS Worker Orientation Module**: Complete the free "Quality, Safety and You" module

For detailed information about the orientation module, see our [NDIS Worker Orientation Module Guide](/blog/ndis-worker-orientation-module-guide/).

### Step 2: Set Up Your Business as a Sole Trader

**Getting Your ABN:**
- Apply for an ABN free at the [Australian Business Register](https://abr.gov.au/)
- An ABN lets you issue compliant invoices and avoid PAYG withholding
- You need to be "carrying on an enterprise" in Australia

For a step-by-step guide, see our detailed [How to Get an ABN as an NDIS Support Worker](/blog/how-to-get-an-abn-as-an-ndis-support-worker/) guide.

**Business Name Registration:**
- If you plan to trade under a name (e.g., "Caring Companion Services") rather than your legal name, register it with ASIC
- You need an ABN before registering a business name

**Business Structure Options:**

| Structure | Setup Cost | Liability | Best For |
|:----------|:-----------|:----------|:---------|
| **Sole Trader** | Free (ABN only) | Personally liable | Most individual support workers |
| **Company** | $550 to $700 | Separates personal/business assets | Larger operations, higher risk |

Most independent support workers start as sole traders due to simplicity and low startup costs.

### Step 3: Arrange Your Insurance

This is non-negotiable for an independent worker. Without appropriate insurance, you risk personal financial liability for any incidents, accidents, or client complaints.

| Insurance Type | Coverage | Annual Cost |
|:---------------|:---------|:------------|
| **Public Liability** | Protects against third-party injury or property damage | $250 to $600 |
| **Professional Indemnity** | Covers claims of negligence or service errors | $300 to $700 |
| **Personal Accident/Income Protection** | Provides income if you're injured and cannot work | $300 to $800 |

**Key Points:**
- Many insurers offer combined PL and PI policies for $600 to $1,500 annually
- Ensure your policy explicitly covers disability support activities
- If you use your vehicle for work, inform your car insurer and consider business-use cover

Specialist brokers include BizCover, HMD Insurance, and Upcover. For comprehensive information, see our guides on [Support Worker Insurance Australia](/blog/support-worker-insurance-australia-what-you-need/) and [How to Get Support Worker Insurance](/blog/how-to-get-support-worker-insurance-in-australia/).

### Step 4: Understand NDIS Registration

Independent support workers can operate as either registered or unregistered providers:

| Feature | Registered Provider | Unregistered Provider |
|:--------|:--------------------|:----------------------|
| **Participant Access** | All funding types (including NDIA-managed) | Self-managed and plan-managed only |
| **Audit Requirement** | Mandatory ($3,000 to $10,000+) | None |
| **Practice Standards** | Must comply | No formal audit |
| **Pricing Rules** | Fixed by NDIS Price Limits | Flexible with self-managed, plan-managed follows limits |
| **Provider Register Listing** | Yes | No |
| **Startup Costs** | Higher | Lower |

Most independent support workers operate as unregistered providers, focusing on self-managed and plan-managed participants. This approach offers lower barriers to entry while still providing access to approximately 60% of the NDIS participant market.

*All workers, registered or not, must comply with the NDIS Code of Conduct.*

### Step 5: Manage Your Finances

**Setting Your Rate:**
Your rate should cover:
- Your time and expertise
- Insurance premiums
- Superannuation contributions (aim for 11% of income)
- Tax obligations (set aside 25-30%)
- Vehicle and travel costs
- Phone, internet, and administration time
- Professional development

**Invoicing Requirements:**
Your invoices must include:
- Provider name & ABN
- Participant name & NDIS number
- Invoice date & unique number
- Dates and description of supports
- Quantity, rate, and total amount (GST status)

Use accounting software like Xero, MYOB, or QuickBooks to streamline invoicing.

**GST Considerations:**
- Register for GST if your annual turnover exceeds $75,000
- Most NDIS supports are GST-free when you have a compliant service agreement in place

### Step 6: Create a Service Agreement

A service agreement is a contract between you and your client. Although only mandatory for Specialist Disability Accommodation, written service agreements are strongly recommended for all supports. They should cover:

- Provider & participant details
- The services to be provided
- Your hourly rates and payment terms
- Schedule of supports
- Cancellation policy (aligned with NDIS rules)
- Dispute resolution process
- GST-free supply confirmation

For templates and detailed guidance, see our [How to Write an NDIS Service Agreement](/blog/how-to-write-an-ndis-service-agreement-template-and-key-clauses/) guide.

## Finding Clients as an Independent NDIS Support Worker

Building a client base is one of the biggest challenges for new independent support workers. Here are the most effective strategies:

### Online Platforms (Mable, Hireup & Others)

Online platforms connect support workers with NDIS participants and are a great place to start:

| Platform | Commission | Features |
|:---------|:-----------|:---------|
| **Mable** | 10 to 15% | Largest marketplace, insurance included |
| **Hireup** | 10 to 15% | Strong focus on participant choice |
| **Careseekers** | 10 to 15% | Wide range of care types |
| **Kynd** | Varies | Community-focused |
| **Home Care Heroes** | Varies | Personalized matching |

**Mable vs Hireup: Key Differences**

The two largest platforms work very differently. With Mable, you operate as an independent contractor. You set your own rates, manage your own insurance, and invoice through the platform. Mable takes a service fee from the participant side. With Hireup, you are employed as a casual worker. Hireup handles your super, insurance, and tax withholding, but you have less control over your rates.

| Feature | Mable | Hireup |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Employment status | Independent contractor | Casual employee |
| Set your own rates | Yes | Limited |
| Insurance provided | Platform coverage included | Covered by employer |
| Super contributions | You manage your own | Paid by Hireup |
| Tax withholding | You handle BAS/GST | PAYG withheld |
| Client base | Largest marketplace | Smaller, curated |

Community feedback on platforms is mixed. Some workers report that Mable offers more flexibility and higher earning potential, while others find Hireup provides more stability and simpler admin. Common concerns include delayed payments, account suspensions without warning, and difficulty resolving disputes through platform support channels. It is worth reading recent reviews and community discussions before committing to a single platform.

**Platform Success Tips:**
- Create comprehensive profiles with photos, qualifications, and experience details
- Respond quickly to inquiries, as faster response time significantly increases booking rates
- Build positive reviews, as they are crucial for ongoing success
- Initial rates may need to be competitive until you establish a reputation
- Consider listing on multiple platforms to diversify your client sources

Most independent workers use platforms initially while developing direct client relationships in parallel. After 6 to 12 months, many transition to more direct relationships.

### Network with Support Coordinators & Plan Managers

Support coordinators and plan managers are key sources of referrals:

- Research active coordinators and plan managers in your service area
- Send professional introduction emails with your service details and credentials
- Provide regular updates on your availability and specializations
- Consistently exceed expectations to generate more referrals
- Provide timely, thorough reporting to increase their confidence

Many successful independent workers derive 40 to 60% of their clients from coordinator referrals after establishing reliability and quality.

### Build Your Digital Presence

A professional online presence enhances credibility and discoverability:

- **Website**: Professional photos, clear service descriptions, qualifications, testimonials ($300 to $500 using Wix or Squarespace)
- **Google Business Profile**: Create and maintain a verified listing for local search
- **SEO**: Optimize for local searches like "NDIS support worker [your area]"
- **Social Media**: Professional profiles on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram
- **Content**: Share valuable information through blogs or social posts

### Word of Mouth

Provide excellent service - happy clients are your best advertisement. Encourage testimonials and referrals from satisfied participants.

## The NDIS Code of Conduct

All workers - registered or unregistered - must adhere to the NDIS Code of Conduct:

1. Act with respect for individual rights
2. Respect privacy and confidentiality
3. Provide supports safely and competently
4. Act with integrity, honesty, and transparency
5. Address quality and safety concerns promptly
6. Prevent and respond to harm
7. Prevent and respond to sexual misconduct
8. Charge fair and reasonable prices

Breaches can lead to warnings, training requirements, or banning orders from the NDIS Commission.

## Challenges and How to Overcome Them

### Income Stability
- **Challenge**: Fluctuating client schedules and cancellations
- **Solutions**: Diversify your client base, implement cancellation policies aligned with NDIS rules, maintain a waiting list

### Administrative Burden
- **Challenge**: Time-consuming paperwork, invoicing, and record keeping
- **Solutions**: Invest in automation tools, batch administrative tasks, use specialized NDIS software

### Professional Isolation
- **Challenge**: Lack of colleague interaction and professional development
- **Solutions**: Join support worker networks, participate in online forums, attend industry conferences

### Work-Life Boundaries
- **Challenge**: Difficulty maintaining work-life balance without organizational support
- **Solutions**: Set clear working hours, designate non-contact days, implement a formal self-care plan

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How much can an independent NDIS support worker earn?

Independent workers typically charge between **$60 to $70 per hour** for standard weekday support in 2026, with higher rates for evenings, weekends, and specialized supports. Your total income depends on how many hours you work and your rates, minus business expenses. Many full-time independent workers earn $75,000 to $110,000+ annually, though this requires a solid client base and efficient business management.

### Do I need qualifications to be an NDIS support worker?

While a Certificate III isn't always legally required for low-risk supports, it is highly recommended and expected by most clients. You **must** have:
- Valid NDIS Worker Screening Check
- First Aid and CPR certification
- Complete the NDIS Worker Orientation Module

For specialized supports like behavior support or early intervention, relevant qualifications are required.

### Do I need to register with the NDIS to work independently?

No, you can work as an unregistered provider with self-managed and plan-managed participants without formal NDIS registration. This provides access to approximately 60% of the participant market with lower barriers to entry.

### How long does it take to build a full client schedule?

Most independent workers take 3 to 6 months to build a full schedule, with 6 to 12 months to establish a waiting list of preferred clients. Platforms like Mable offer the quickest route to finding initial clients.

### Can I work both independently and for an agency?

Yes, many support workers maintain both independent clients and agency shifts. However, check agency contracts for exclusivity clauses that may restrict this arrangement.

### What happens if a client cancels at short notice?

For self-managed participants, you can implement the NDIS cancellation policy, which allows charging 100% of the scheduled support fee for cancellations with less than 7 days' notice (or less than 2 clear business days for some supports).

### Is it better to be a sole trader or work for an agency?

It depends on your goals:
- **Choose sole trader** if you want maximum flexibility, higher earning potential, and are comfortable running a business
- **Choose agency** if you prefer security, consistent work, less admin, and employer-provided insurance and superannuation

### How do I handle tax and super as a sole trader?

You are responsible for:
- Putting aside money for income tax (approximately 25-30% of income)
- Contributing to your own superannuation fund (aim for 11% of income)
- Tracking business expenses for deductions (vehicle, phone, insurance, etc.)
- Registering for GST if turnover exceeds $75,000

Consider engaging an accountant familiar with NDIS work to set this up correctly.

### What's the difference between registered and unregistered NDIS providers?

As a **registered provider**, you undergo quality audits, can service all participant types, and must adhere to NDIS Price Limits. Registration costs $3,000-$10,000+ depending on services offered.

As an **unregistered provider**, you avoid these audits and costs but can only work with self-managed and plan-managed participants. You have greater pricing flexibility with self-managed clients.

### What insurance do I need as an independent NDIS support worker?

At minimum:
- **Public Liability**: $10-20 million coverage ($250-$600/year)
- **Professional Indemnity**: $2-5 million coverage ($300-$700/year)

Many combined policies are available for $600-$1,500 annually. Also consider income protection insurance and vehicle coverage with business use.
