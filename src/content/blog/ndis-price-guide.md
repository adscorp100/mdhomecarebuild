## How to Use the NDIS Price Guide

The NDIS Price Guide (officially called the Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits, or PAPL) is the document that sets the maximum prices registered NDIS providers can charge for supports and services. It is released each financial year by the NDIA, with mid-year updates when needed. The current version is v1.1, released in October 2025 and effective from 24 November 2025.

**For participants:** The price guide helps you understand the maximum cost of supports in your plan. Plan-managed participants can negotiate rates below the price limit. Self-managed participants can choose any provider, including those charging above the limit.

**For providers:** The price guide sets your billing ceiling. You must not charge above the price limit for registered supports. The NDIS Support Catalogue (Excel download) contains every line item code you need for invoicing.

**For support workers:** The price guide sets what providers can charge, not what you earn. Your pay is governed by the SCHADS Award. See our [NDIS Support Worker Pay Rates guide](/blog/ndis-support-worker-pay-rates/) for detailed worker pay information.
