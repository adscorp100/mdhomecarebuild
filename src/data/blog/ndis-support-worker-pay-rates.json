For example:<ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Weekday Daytime Support</strong>: Any support from 6 am to 8 pm on Monday to Friday, unless it's a public holiday or night-time sleepover.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Weekday Evening Support</strong>: From 8 pm to midnight on weekdays.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Weekday Night Support (Active Overnight)</strong>: Starting at or before midnight and finishing after midnight on a weekday.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Weekend Daytime Support</strong>: 6 am to 8 pm on Saturdays or Sundays.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Weekend Evening Support</strong>: 8 pm to midnight on weekends.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Public Holiday Support</strong>: Any support provided on a public holiday, typically at the highest rates.</li></ul></li><li id=\"\">Research shows that NDIS evening rates and night rates are higher than daytime rates, with NDIS Sunday rates and public holiday rates being even higher to compensate for non-standard hours.
