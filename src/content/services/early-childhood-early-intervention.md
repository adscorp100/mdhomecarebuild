## What is Early Childhood Early Intervention (ECEI) in {suburb}?

The Early Childhood Approach (formerly ECEI) is the NDIS pathway for supporting children younger than 9 with developmental delay or disability, and their families in {suburb}. This family-centered approach emphasizes timely, evidence-based intervention to build children's skills and support their inclusion in mainstream and community settings.

### Key Features of the Early Childhood Approach in {suburb}:

- No formal diagnosis required for children under 6 to access initial support
- Family-centered practice that empowers parents and caregivers
- Evidence-based interventions tailored to each child's unique needs
- Focus on inclusion in mainstream and community settings throughout {suburb}

## How the Early Childhood Approach Works in {suburb}

### Initial Contact with an Early Childhood Partner

NDIS Early Childhood Partners are the first point of contact for families in {suburb}. These specialized organizations, funded by the NDIA, help families:

- Access information about available supports and services
- Connect with community and mainstream services
- Determine if NDIS access is required for longer-term support

### Types of Early Childhood Supports Available in {suburb}

Children accessing this pathway often receive therapies such as:

- Occupational Therapy for sensory processing and fine motor skills
- Speech Pathology for communication and language development
- Physiotherapy for gross motor skills and physical development
- Psychology for behavioral and emotional support
- Group-based early intervention programs in {suburb}

## Finding Early Childhood Partners in {suburb}

While MD Homecare does not provide specialized early childhood intervention services, we can help connect families in {suburb} with their local Early Childhood Partner. These partners are geographically assigned and include organizations such as:

- Mission Australia (in Southeast Tasmania)
- EACH (in parts of Queensland, New South Wales, and ACT)
- Other specialized therapy providers focusing on early childhood

## The Importance of Early Intervention

Research shows that early intervention during critical developmental periods can significantly improve outcomes for children with developmental delays or disability. Accessing timely supports in {suburb} can:

- Enhance developmental outcomes
- Strengthen family capacity to support their child
- Promote inclusion in the broader community
- Potentially reduce the need for intensive supports later in life

## The Thriving Kids Program and Early Childhood Services

From October 2026, the Australian Government's [Thriving Kids program](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/thriving-kids) will create a new pathway for children under 9 with low to moderate autism or developmental delay. Funded at $4 billion over five years (split between Commonwealth and state governments), Thriving Kids will operate alongside the NDIS rather than replacing it. Children with high support needs will continue to access the NDIS, and children already on the NDIS will remain on their current plans.

A key difference is that Thriving Kids will not require a formal diagnosis to access services, making it easier for families to get early support. Full rollout is expected by January 2028. For families in {suburb} considering early childhood intervention, this means there will soon be two pathways available: the NDIS Early Childhood Approach for children with significant disability, and Thriving Kids for those with lower support needs. We recommend speaking with your Early Childhood Partner about which pathway best suits your child's situation.
