The Australian Government has introduced significant changes to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) through the *NDIS Amendment (Integrity and Safeguarding) Bill 2025*. This legislation marks a major shift in how the scheme is regulated, with a sharp focus on protecting participants and ensuring the financial sustainability of the NDIS.

For NDIS providers, this bill raises the bar for compliance and accountability. For participants, it aims to deliver safer, higher-quality supports while cracking down on exploitative practices.

Here is what you need to know about the new legislation and how it affects you.

## Key Points

*   **Introduction:** The bill was introduced to Parliament on November 26, 2025.
*   **Focus:** It strengthens the powers of the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission (NDIS Commission) and the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA).
*   **Goal:** To improve the integrity of the scheme and enhance safeguarding for participants.
*   **Impact:** Providers face stricter compliance requirements regarding who can deliver supports and how payments are managed.

## What is the Bill?

The *NDIS Amendment (Integrity and Safeguarding) Bill 2025* proposes 10 key amendments to the *National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013*. These changes are designed to close regulatory gaps that have previously allowed unethical practices to occur.

The bill is a direct response to ongoing concerns about fraud, non-compliance, and the safety of NDIS participants. By giving the NDIS Commission stronger regulatory powers, the government intends to weed out dodgy providers and ensure that funding is used correctly.

### Why Now?

The NDIS has grown rapidly, and with that growth has come increased scrutiny. Reviews and inquiries have highlighted the need for a more robust regulatory framework. This bill is the government's answer to those calls, ensuring that the scheme remains sustainable and safe for the thousands of Australians who rely on it.

## What It Means for NDIS Providers

If you are an NDIS provider, this bill signals a time to review your compliance processes. The "set and forget" approach to registration and compliance is no longer sufficient.

### stricter Compliance and Accountability

The bill introduces measures that significantly raise the bar for provider behavior. This extends beyond simply defining what supports can be funded. It now looks more closely at:

*   **Who can deliver supports:** Stricter vetting processes may be applied to key personnel.
*   **Terms of service:** Clearer guidelines on service agreements and the conditions under which support is provided.
*   **Payment integrity:** Enhanced scrutiny on claims and payments to prevent fraud.

Providers must ensure their documentation, staff screening, and service delivery models are fully compliant with the new standards. Ignorance of the changes will not be a valid defense if the NDIS Commission takes enforcement action.

### Expanded Regulatory Powers

The NDIS Commission will have broader powers to investigate and take action against non-compliant providers. This could include higher penalties for breaches and more rigorous audit requirements. The focus is on removing providers who do not act in the best interests of participants.

## What It Means for NDIS Participants

For participants, the primary goal of this bill is safety. The amendments are designed to create a protective barrier against exploitation and substandard care.

### Better Protection

By strengthening the regulator's powers, the bill aims to remove unsafe providers from the market more quickly. This means participants can have greater confidence that the services they receive meet high quality and safety standards.

### Balancing Safety and Choice

Submissions from groups like the Allied Health Professions Australia (AHPA) have highlighted the need to balance safety with access. While stricter rules are necessary to protect participants, it is also important that these rules do not create unnecessary barriers to accessing services.

The government has stated that these changes are about integrity, not about cutting legitimate supports. Participants should continue to receive the reasonable and necessary supports outlined in their plans, but with added assurance that their providers are operating ethically.

## Key Changes in the Bill

While the full text of the legislation contains detailed legal amendments, the core changes focus on these areas:

1.  **Strengthening the NDIS Commission:** Giving the regulator more tools to monitor and enforce compliance.
2.  **Information Sharing:** Improving the ability of the NDIA and the NDIS Commission to share information about provider conduct and participant safety.
3.  **Banning Orders:** Clarifying and potentially expanding the scope for banning unsuitable providers or workers.
4.  **Registration Requirements:** Tightening the criteria for becoming and remaining a registered NDIS provider.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will these changes take effect?
The bill was introduced in late 2025. Specific commencement dates will depend on when the legislation passes both houses of Parliament and receives Royal Assent. Providers should start preparing now.
