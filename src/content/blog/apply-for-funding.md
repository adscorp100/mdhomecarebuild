‍

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does the NDIS application process take?
The NDIS application timeline varies depending on completeness of documentation and individual circumstances. Once you submit a properly completed Access Request Form with all supporting evidence, the NDIA typically makes an access decision within 21 days. However, if additional information is requested, the clock pauses until you provide it, potentially extending the process by weeks or months. For complex cases or during high-volume periods, the entire process from initial contact to approval can take 2-4 months. Applications for children under 7 through Early Childhood partners are often processed more quickly. To minimize delays, ensure all documentation is comprehensive, recent (less than 12 months old), and clearly demonstrates how your disability affects daily functioning.

### What happens if my NDIS application is rejected?
If your application is rejected, you'll receive a letter explaining the decision. You have several options: (1) Request an internal review within 3 months by completing the Application for Review of a Reviewable Decision form; (2) Provide new or additional evidence that better demonstrates your eligibility; (3) Seek assistance from disability advocacy services who can help challenge the decision; or (4) If the internal review is unsuccessful, apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) for an external review within 28 days. The most common reasons for rejection include insufficient evidence of functional impact, inadequate documentation of the permanence of the disability, or not meeting residency requirements. Working with advocacy organizations like SCIA, AED Legal, or your local disability advocacy service can significantly improve your chances during the review process.

### Do I need a formal diagnosis to apply for the NDIS?
While a formal diagnosis strongly supports your application, it's not always mandatory. The NDIS focuses primarily on the functional impact of your disability rather than the diagnosis itself. However, having a clear diagnosis from a relevant specialist (such as a psychiatrist for mental health conditions or neurologist for neurological conditions) significantly strengthens your application and makes the approval process smoother. If obtaining a formal diagnosis is difficult due to waitlists or costs, you can still apply by providing substantial evidence of functional impact through functional assessments, supporting statements from healthcare providers, and detailed descriptions of how your condition affects daily activities. For some conditions like autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability, a formal diagnosis is practically essential.

### Can someone help me with my NDIS application?
Yes, several supports are available: (1) Local Area Coordinators (LACs) provide free assistance for applicants aged 7-65, helping with eligibility checks, paperwork completion, and gathering evidence; (2) Early Childhood Partners assist families with children under 7; (3) Support Coordinators can help if you're already receiving some disability services; (4) Disability advocacy organizations offer independent support, particularly valuable if your application is complex or denied; (5) Community health services often have social workers familiar with the NDIS process. Additionally, some healthcare providers like occupational therapists can help document functional impacts. For culturally appropriate support, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can seek assistance from Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organizations, while people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds can access interpreters through TIS National (13 14 50).

### What evidence do I need for an NDIS application?
The evidence required varies by disability type but generally includes: (1) Proof of age, residency, and identity (birth certificate, passport, or Medicare card); (2) Recent medical reports from relevant specialists (neurologists, psychiatrists, pediatricians) documenting your condition's permanence and functional impact; (3) Functional assessments (like WHODAS for adults or PEDI-CAT for children) measuring how your disability affects daily activities; (4) Treatment and support history; and (5) Supporting statements from allied health professionals (occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech pathologists). For psychosocial disabilities, the Evidence of Psychosocial Disability form must be completed by a psychiatrist, psychologist, or GP with mental health experience. Documents should be less than 12 months old and clearly demonstrate that your condition is permanent (or likely permanent) and significantly impacts your ability to participate in daily activities.

### Can I apply for the NDIS if I'm not an Australian citizen?
Yes, but eligibility depends on your visa status. Permanent residents, Protected Special Category visa holders (New Zealanders who arrived before February 26, 2001), and holders of permanent protection visas can apply if they meet the disability and age requirements. However, those on temporary visas like student visas, working visas, or temporary protection visas are generally not eligible for the NDIS. Humanitarian entrants (refugees) with permanent residency status can apply. If you're unsure about your eligibility based on residency status, contact the NDIS directly at 1800 800 110 or seek advice from a migration agent or community legal center. Alternative support may be available through state-based disability services, community health services, or charitable organizations if you're ineligible for the NDIS due to visa status.

### What supports can I get through the NDIS if approved?
Once approved, the NDIS can fund a wide range of disability-related supports aligned with your goals, including: (1) Daily personal activities assistance (showering, dressing, meal preparation); (2) Transport to enable community participation; (3) Workplace help (modifications, support workers); (4) Therapeutic supports (occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech therapy, psychology); (5) Home modifications to improve accessibility; (6) Mobility equipment (wheelchairs, prosthetics); (7) Vehicle modifications; (8) Communication devices and assistive technology; (9) Support coordination to help implement your plan; and (10) Capacity building supports to increase independence. The NDIS doesn't fund supports better provided by mainstream services (education, health, housing), items everyone pays for (food, rent, utilities), or supports not related to your disability. Following approval, you'll develop a plan with a planner or LAC that outlines your goals and the reasonable and necessary supports to achieve them.
