Your NDIS Schedule of Supports is the roadmap to your funding—but for many participants, it can look like a confusing spreadsheet of codes and numbers. Understanding this document is essential for getting the most out of your plan.

This guide explains exactly how to read your Schedule of Supports, what each category means, the difference between stated and flexible supports, and provides a free template you can use to track your spending.

## What is a Schedule of Supports?

The Schedule of Supports is the detailed breakdown inside your NDIS plan that lists every funded support you're approved to receive. Think of it as your plan's budget allocation document.

It shows:
- **What** supports you're funded for (support items)
- **How much** funding is allocated (dollar amounts)
- **How many** units you can access (hours, sessions, or items)
- **How** the plan is managed (NDIA, plan, or self-managed)

### Where to Find Your Schedule of Supports

Your Schedule of Supports appears:
- **In your plan document** (usually pages 2-4 of the PDF)
- **In the MyPlace portal** under "My Plan" → "Support Schedule"
- **From your Support Coordinator** or Plan Manager (they can provide a copy)

## Understanding the Schedule of Supports Layout

Your schedule is organised into columns. Here's what each one means:

| Column | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Support Category** | Core, Capacity Building, or Capital |
| **Support Item Code** | A numbered code (e.g., 15_056_0128_1_3) that identifies the specific support |
| **Support Item Name** | Plain English description (e.g., "Occupational Therapy") |
| **Units** | Number of hours, sessions, or items approved |
| **Price Limit** | Maximum amount providers can charge per unit |
| **Total Budget** | Units × Price Limit = your allocation for that item |
| **Provider** | If pre-allocated, the provider's name |
| **Period** | Start and end dates of the funding |

### Reading Line Items

Let's look at a typical line item:

```
Category: Capacity Building - Daily Living
Code: 15_056_0128_1_3
Name: Occupational Therapy
Units: 20 hours
Price Limit: $193.99/hour
Total: $3,879.80
Period: 01 Jul 2025 - 30 Jun 2026
```

This tells you:
- You have 20 hours of occupational therapy funded
- Providers can charge up to $193.99 per hour
- Your total OT budget is $3,879.80 for the year

## The Three Support Categories Explained

All NDIS funding falls into three main categories:

### 1. Core Supports

Core Supports help with everyday activities and current disability-related needs. This is typically the largest portion of your plan.

| Core Support Type | What It Covers | Example Items |
|-------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Assistance with Daily Life** | Personal care, household tasks | Support workers, cleaning, meal prep |
| **Consumables** | Everyday items | Continence products, low-cost AT |
| **Assistance with Social & Community Participation** | Getting out and about | Support worker to attend activities |
| **Transport** | Getting to appointments and activities | Taxi/rideshare, support worker travel |

**Key feature:** Core Supports are generally **flexible within the category**. You can shift funding between different Core items as needed (except for some stated items).

### 2. Capacity Building Supports

Capacity Building Supports help you build skills and independence over time. This funding is designed to help you need less support in the future.

| CB Support Type | What It Covers | Example Items |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Support Coordination** | Help managing your plan | Support Coordinator services |
| **Improved Daily Living** | Therapy and assessments | OT, physio, psychology, speech |
| **Improved Relationships** | Social skills, behaviour support | Behaviour support practitioners |
| **Improved Life Choices** | Plan management | Plan Manager fees |
| **Employment** | Finding and keeping work | Employment support |
| **Health & Wellbeing** | Exercise and health management | Exercise physiology, dietitian |

**Key feature:** Capacity Building is generally **not flexible** between categories. You can't use therapy funding for support coordination, for example.

### 3. Capital Supports

Capital Supports are for larger, one-off investments like equipment and home modifications.

| Capital Support Type | What It Covers | Examples |
|---------------------|----------------|----------|
| **Assistive Technology** | Equipment and devices | Wheelchairs, communication devices |
| **Home Modifications** | Changes to your home | Ramps, bathroom modifications |
| **Vehicle Modifications** | Changes to vehicles | Wheelchair hoists, hand controls |

**Key feature:** Capital Supports are **very specific**. Each item must be individually approved and is usually stated (not flexible).

## Stated vs Flexible Supports

Understanding the difference between stated and flexible supports is crucial for managing your plan effectively.

### Stated Supports

Stated supports are specifically listed in your schedule with a defined amount. They're often:
- For specific purposes (like home modifications)
- Required for compliance reasons
- High-cost items needing NDIA approval

**Example:** "Wheelchair - $5,000" is a stated support. You can only use that $5,000 for the wheelchair.

### Flexible Supports

Flexible supports give you choice within a category. The funding is available but not locked to a specific item.

**Example:** "$8,000 - Core Supports" might let you choose between more support worker hours, transport, or consumables—whatever you need most.

### How to Tell the Difference

| Indicator | Likely Stated | Likely Flexible |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Specific item named | ✅ | |
| General category budget | | ✅ |
| High-cost capital item | ✅ | |
| Core Supports | Sometimes | Usually |
| Capacity Building | Usually | Sometimes |

> **Pro tip:** If you're unsure, ask your Support Coordinator or call the NDIS. Using stated funding for the wrong purpose can create compliance issues.

## Plan Management Options

How your plan is managed affects how you access your Schedule of Supports:

### NDIA-Managed (Agency-Managed)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who manages** | The NDIA processes all claims |
| **Provider choice** | Must use registered providers only |
| **Your admin** | Minimal—providers claim directly |
| **Flexibility** | Limited |

**Best for:** People who want minimal paperwork and are happy using registered providers.

### Plan-Managed

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who manages** | A Plan Management provider |
| **Provider choice** | Can use registered AND unregistered providers |
| **Your admin** | Low—plan manager handles claims |
| **Flexibility** | High |
| **Cost** | Plan management fee comes from your plan |

**Best for:** People who want flexibility without the admin burden.

### Self-Managed

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who manages** | You (or a nominee) |
| **Provider choice** | Can use anyone |
| **Your admin** | High—you process all claims |
| **Flexibility** | Maximum |
| **Cost** | No management fee |

**Best for:** People comfortable with admin who want maximum control.

### Can You Mix Management Types?

Yes. You can have different categories managed differently. For example:
- Core Supports: Self-managed
- Capacity Building: Plan-managed
- Capital: NDIA-managed

This is called a "mixed management" arrangement.

### How to Use the Template

1. **Enter your plan details** when you receive your new plan
2. **Update "Used" column** after each service or invoice
3. **Calculate "Remaining"** to see what's left
4. **Add notes** about pacing (are you using too fast? too slow?)
5. **Review monthly** to avoid underspending or overspending

### Pacing Your Budget

A common mistake is running out of funding before your plan ends—or having unused funds that expire.

**Simple pacing calculation:**
- Divide your annual budget by 12 = monthly target
- Track whether you're ahead or behind

**Example:**
- Annual Core budget: $24,000
- Monthly target: $2,000
- If you've spent $2,500 in month 1, you're $500 over pace

## Common Schedule of Supports Questions

### Can I move money between categories?

**Generally no.** You cannot move funding from Core to Capacity Building or vice versa. However:
- You CAN usually move funds within Core categories
- Some Capacity Building funds are flexible within that category
- Capital funds are almost never flexible

If you need to change your category allocations, you'll need a plan review.

### What happens to unused funding?

Unused funding at the end of your plan period **does not roll over**. It's lost. This is why tracking your spending is important—you want to use what you need, not leave money on the table.

### Can I spend more than my allocated amount?

No. Once a category is exhausted, you cannot access more funding until your next plan (unless you request a plan review due to changed circumstances).

### What if a line item runs out but I still have category budget?

If your schedule shows flexible funding within a category, you may be able to continue accessing services using the remaining category budget. Check with your Support Coordinator or Plan Manager.

### How do I know if my plan is on track?

**Quick check:**
- Calculate what percentage of your plan period has passed
- Compare to what percentage of budget you've used
- They should roughly match

**Example:** 6 months into a 12-month plan (50%), you should have used approximately 50% of your budget.

## Tips for Managing Your Schedule of Supports

### 1. Review Your Plan Immediately
When you receive a new plan, check:
- Are the funded items what you expected?
- Are the amounts reasonable for your needs?
- Is anything missing that you requested?

Request a review within 3 months if something is wrong.

### 2. Set Up a Tracking System
Whether it's our template, your Plan Manager's portal, or the MyPlace system—track your spending from day one.

### 3. Communicate with Your Support Coordinator
Your Support Coordinator can:
- Help you understand your schedule
- Identify flexibility in your funding
- Alert you to pacing issues
- Help request changes if needed

### 4. Plan for the End of Plan Period
About 2-3 months before your plan ends:
- Review what's left unspent
- Book any needed assessments or reports
- Use remaining therapy hours
- Prepare for your plan review meeting

### 5. Keep Records
Save:
- Invoices from all providers
- Service agreements
- Receipts (especially for self-managed)
- Notes about what worked and didn't

These help at plan review time.

## When to Request a Plan Review

You can request a plan review if:
- Your circumstances have changed significantly
- You need different types of support
- Your funding is running out too quickly
- You're not using your funding because it doesn't match your needs
- You've had a major life change (moved house, started work, health crisis)

Don't wait until your plan is exhausted—request reviews early when you notice issues.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between a plan and a Schedule of Supports?

Your **plan** is the overall document outlining your goals, needs, and funding. The **Schedule of Supports** is the specific section listing exactly what supports are funded and how much.

### How often does my Schedule of Supports change?

Your schedule is set for your plan period (usually 12-24 months). It only changes if you request and receive a plan review, or when your plan is renewed.

### Can I change providers without changing my schedule?

Yes, unless a specific provider is stated in your plan. You can generally change providers while keeping the same funding allocation.

### What if I don't understand my schedule?

Contact:
- Your Support Coordinator
- Your Plan Manager
- The NDIS helpline (1800 800 110)
- A disability advocate

Never feel embarrassed to ask for help understanding your plan.
