The module consists of interactive learning scenarios that reflect real-world situations NDIS workers might encounter. By working through these scenarios, participants develop an understanding of rights-based approaches to service delivery, risk identification, and appropriate responses to incidents of abuse or neglect.

Completing the module is a fundamental step for anyone working in the NDIS sector, regardless of their role or previous experience. It establishes a consistent national standard for quality and safety across all NDIS services.
