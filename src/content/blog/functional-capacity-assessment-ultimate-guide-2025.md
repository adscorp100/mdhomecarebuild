## What is a Functional Capacity Assessment?

A functional capacity assessment (FCA) is a comprehensive evaluation that measures your ability to perform daily activities and participate in community life. For NDIS participants, FCAs provide crucial evidence to support funding decisions and ensure you receive appropriate supports for your disability-related needs. For more background, see our guides on [functional capacity assessments in the NDIS](/blog/functional-capacity-assessments-in-the-ndis) and [what an FCA is and why it matters](/blog/functional-capacity-assessment-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters).

### Purpose of Functional Capacity Assessments

**NDIS Funding Justification**
- Evidence for reasonable and necessary supports
- Documentation of functional limitations
- Baseline measurement for progress tracking
- Support for assistive technology requests
- Justification for home modifications

**Assessment Domains**
- **Activities of Daily Living**: Personal care, mobility, communication
- **Domestic Tasks**: Cooking, cleaning, shopping, household management
- **Community Participation**: Social activities, employment, education
- **Cognitive Function**: Memory, problem-solving, decision-making
- **Physical Capabilities**: Strength, endurance, coordination, balance
- **Psychosocial Functioning**: Mental health, social skills, coping strategies

The final output is a detailed report. You can see an example in our guide on [what a good FCA report looks like](/blog/functional-capacity-assessment-report-example-what-a-good-one-looks-like). This is just one type of report used in the NDIS; another important one is the [Carer Impact Statement](/blog/ndis-reports-carer-impact-statements-templates-examples).
