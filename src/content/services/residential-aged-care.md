## Why {suburb} Families Choose MD Home Care

### We Know the Local Aged Care Landscape
Our advisors have relationships with aged care facilities across {suburb} and surrounding areas. We know which homes have strong clinical teams, which have vibrant lifestyle programs, and which to avoid.

### We're Independent Advocates

### We Save You Time & Stress
The average family spends 40+ hours researching aged care options. We compress this into a streamlined process, presenting you with the best options based on your specific needs.

## Still Exploring Options? Consider In-Home Care First

Before committing to residential care, it's worth exploring whether staying at home with the right support is possible. Many families are surprised by what can be achieved with a comprehensive Home Care Package.

MD Home Care can provide:
*   **24/7 In-Home Nursing Care** for complex medical needs
*   **Daily Personal Care** assistance with showering, dressing, and mobility
*   **Domestic Assistance** for cleaning, cooking, and home management
*   **Respite Care** to give family carers a break

For some, a combination of these services can delay or even prevent the need to move into a facility—while staying in the comfort of home.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How much do your aged care support services cost?**
Our initial consultation is free. Ongoing support services vary depending on the level of assistance you need. Many families use their Home Care Package funds to cover our navigation services. We also offer private-pay options with transparent, hourly pricing.

**How is residential aged care funded?**
Residential aged care is funded through a combination of government subsidies and resident contributions. The amount you pay depends on a means assessment of your income and assets. Aged care specialists through MD Home Care help you understand exactly what you'll pay before you commit.

**What is an ACAT assessment?**
An Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) assessment determines your eligibility for government-subsidised aged care. Aged care specialists through MD Home Care help you prepare for this assessment and ensure your care needs are accurately captured.

**Can you help if we're under pressure from a hospital discharge?**
Yes. Hospital discharge situations require quick action, but you shouldn't sacrifice quality for speed. We have experience working with hospital social workers and can fast-track our process to find appropriate placements within tight timeframes.

**What if we decide to keep Mum at home instead?**
That's a great outcome! If our assessment finds that in-home care is a viable option, we can seamlessly transition you to our home care services team. There's no pressure to choose residential care.
