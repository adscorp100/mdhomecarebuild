              <p>Here's a functional capacity assessment example of how an OT might assess you:</p>
              <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Kitchen task:</strong> The OT asks you to make a cup of tea. They observe your mobility (walking to kitchen), balance (standing at bench), ability to follow steps (sequencing), fine motor skills (opening containers, handling kettle), and safety awareness (hot water handling).</li>
                <li><strong>Personal care:</strong> They may ask you to demonstrate putting on shoes, buttoning a shirt, or describe your showering routine in detail.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> They observe how you move around your home, use stairs, get in/out of chairs, and transfer from bed.</li>
                <li><strong>Community access:</strong> They discuss how you travel, shop, and access services.</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="mt-2">Throughout, they're noting not just whether you CAN do something, but HOW you do it, how long it takes, and whether it's safe.</p>
