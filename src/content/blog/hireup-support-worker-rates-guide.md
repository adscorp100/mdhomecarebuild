## What is Hireup?

Hireup is one of Australia's largest online platforms connecting NDIS participants with support workers. Unlike traditional disability service providers, Hireup operates as an **employment platform**—all support workers on Hireup are directly employed by the company as casual employees, not independent contractors.

This employment model means Hireup handles:
- Superannuation contributions
- Workers' compensation insurance
- Public liability insurance
- Tax withholding (PAYG)
- SCHADS Award compliance

For NDIS participants, Hireup offers a way to find and book support workers through an app or website, with transparent pricing and the security of knowing all workers are vetted, insured, and employed.

## How Hireup Compares to Other NDIS Platforms

### Hireup vs Mable

| Feature | Hireup | Mable |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Worker Status** | Employed (casual) | Independent contractor |
| **Client Weekday Rate** | $69.09/hour | ~$63/hour average (with fees) |

### Hireup vs Traditional Providers

| Feature | Hireup | Traditional Provider |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| **Choice of Worker** | You choose from profiles | Often assigned |
| **Consistency** | Same workers if available | May vary |
| **Booking Flexibility** | App-based, flexible | Often scheduled in advance |
| **Rate Transparency** | Published online | May vary, sometimes less transparent |
| **Worker Pool** | Large national network | May be limited by location |

### Who Should Use Hireup?

**Hireup may be ideal if you:**
- Want to choose your own support workers
- Value the security of employed (not contractor) workers
- Are agency-managed and need a registered NDIS provider
- Want transparent, predictable pricing
- Prefer app-based booking and management

**You might prefer alternatives if you:**
- Want to negotiate rates directly with workers
- Are self-managed and want maximum flexibility
- Prefer to work with local, independent support workers
- Want lower overall costs (platforms like Mable may be cheaper)

## Understanding NDIS Price Limits

Hireup's rates are designed to fit within the **NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits** set by the NDIA. Here's how the 2026-27 NDIS price limits compare:

### NDIS Price Limits vs Hireup Rates

| Support Type | NDIS Price Limit | Hireup Rate |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Weekday Daytime** | $70.23/hour | $69.09/hour |
| **Saturday** | $98.16/hour | $90.27/hour |
| **Sunday** | $126.09/hour | $116.23/hour |
| **Public Holiday** | $154.02/hour | $150.93/hour |

As you can see, Hireup's rates fall **within or below** the NDIS price limits, meaning participants can use Hireup regardless of how their plan is managed (self-managed, plan-managed, or agency-managed).

### Online Platforms

- **Mable**: Independent contractor model with negotiable rates
- **Like Family**: Social support and companionship focused

- **Better Caring**: Platform for finding aged care and disability support

### Traditional Providers

Traditional NDIS providers like **MD Home Care** offer a different approach:

- Preference for flexibility vs consistency
- Comfort with technology
- Local availability of workers
