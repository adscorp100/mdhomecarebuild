## Key Points- Improved liveability SDA enhances living conditions for NDIS participants with sensory, intellectual, or cognitive impairments, focusing on accessibility and safety.
- Features include wide doorways, luminance contrasts, and noise reduction, meeting Liveable Housing Australia Silver Level standards.
- Suitable for those not needing extensive physical support, with funding typically covered by NDIS plans and a small rent contribution from participants.
- There is some controversy, as the NDIS Review recommended removing this category for new developments, but it remains in place as of March 2025.

## What is Improved Liveability SDA?Improved liveability SDA is a type of specialist disability accommodation designed to improve living conditions for individuals with sensory, intellectual, or cognitive impairments. It provides a reasonable level of physical access and includes specific features to promote independence and safety.

## Key Features and SuitabilityThis category includes design elements like wide doorways, accessible bathrooms, and luminance contrasts for better visibility, which are particularly helpful for those with visual impairments. It seems likely to be suitable for NDIS participants who do not require extensive physical support but need accommodations for cognitive or sensory needs.

## Funding and AccessThe evidence leans toward NDIS funding covering the capital cost, with participants possibly paying a small rent contribution. To find properties, work with your NDIS support coordinator and check registered providers like Enliven Housing.

## Potential ChangesAn interesting aspect is the ongoing debate about its future, with a recommendation to remove it for new developments, yet it remains a valid option as of March 2025, offering continuity for current and future participants.

## Understanding Improved Liveability SDAImproved Liveability SDA refers to housing specifically designed or updated to incorporate a reasonable level of physical access and enhanced provisions for people with sensory, intellectual, or cognitive impairments. It aims to improve living conditions by addressing unique needs through thoughtful design elements, going beyond basic accessibility to create an environment that promotes independence and a sense of belonging.

The design must meet the minimum requirements of Liveable Housing Australia's Silver Level, ensuring physical accessibility for residents. It includes features tailored to support navigation and comfort, such as luminance contrasts, improved wayfinding, and task lighting, making it distinct from other categories focused on physical or behavioral needs.

## Eligibility and SuitabilityImproved Liveability SDA is suitable for NDIS participants who have sensory impairments (e.g., visual or hearing loss), intellectual or cognitive impairments (e.g., autism, Down syndrome, dementia), and do not require the high levels of physical access or robust features of other SDA categories.

This category is particularly beneficial for individuals who find it difficult to see or understand their surroundings, offering a calming and accessible space with features like adjustable lighting and noise reduction.

## Key Design FeaturesThe design features of Improved Liveability SDA are extensive and focus on enhancing physical access and supporting sensory, intellectual, or cognitive needs. These include:

- **Physical Access:** Wide doorways, ramps instead of stairs, accessible bathrooms with grab bars, and lower benchtops in kitchens, ensuring ease of movement.
- **Sensory Support:** Luminance contrasts to improve visibility for residents with sensory impairments, task lighting, and visual assistance lines for better navigation.
- **Cognitive Support:** Improved wayfinding with clear signage and limited corridors, open-plan living spaces to reduce confusion, and uncluttered areas to minimize obstacles.
- **Comfort and Safety:** Adjustable lighting that can be dimmed or brightened to reduce sensory overload, noise reduction through soundproofing materials, and calming colors and textures to promote a sense of calm.

## Finding Improved Liveability SDA PropertiesAccessing Improved Liveability SDA involves several steps:

- **NDIS Plan Inclusion:** Ensure your NDIS plan includes SDA funding, discussed during planning meetings or via a change of circumstances request.
- **Assessment and Coordination:** Work with your NDIS support coordinator to determine eligibility and identify suitable properties.
- **Registered Providers:** Look for registered SDA providers offering improved liveability options, such as Accessible Homes Australia or Enliven Housing.
- **Property Inspection:** Visit potential properties to assess if they meet your specific needs, considering location, design features, and proximity to support services.
- **Application Process:** Follow the provider's application process, which may involve submitting your NDIS plan and supporting documentation.

## Costs and FundingSDA funding is provided through the participant's NDIS plan, covering the capital cost of the accommodation. It does not include support services, which are funded separately, often through Supported Independent Living (SIL).

Participants typically pay a Reasonable Rent Contribution (RRC), limited to 25% of the Disability Support Pension plus Commonwealth Rent Assistance, ensuring affordability. Additional costs, such as utilities and ongoing maintenance, may be incurred.

## Maintenance and SupportMaintenance is the responsibility of the SDA provider, who must ensure the property remains safe and compliant with NDIS standards. Participants can report maintenance issues, and providers are obligated to address urgent and non-urgent repairs.

Support services, such as personal care, cooking assistance, and shopping, are separate and typically managed by SIL providers, funded through other NDIS plan categories.

## Recent Developments and Future OutlookA notable development is the NDIS Review's recommendation to remove the Improved Liveability category for new developments. However, as of March 2025, it remains a valid category, with sector submissions opposing the change, indicating potential continuity. This ongoing debate highlights the need for participants to stay informed about future policy shifts.

## Frequently Asked Questions- **Can I switch SDA categories if my needs change?** Yes, you can request a review of your NDIS plan to adjust funding if your needs evolve, discussed with your support coordinator.
- **Are there additional costs not covered by NDIS?** Yes, utilities and personal support services may require separate funding or contributions.
- **How do I know if Improved Liveability is right for me?** Consult with your NDIS planner and medical professionals to assess your specific impairments and housing needs.
