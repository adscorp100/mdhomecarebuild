## A Clear Guide to Allied Health Services

"Allied Health" is a term used to describe a broad range of health professionals who are not doctors or nurses. If you or a loved one has been recommended for allied health services, it can be confusing to know what that actually means.

Think of allied health professionals as specialists who provide therapeutic and support services to help you manage your health, recover from illness or injury, and live as independently as possible.

This guide breaks down the most common types of allied health services we offer, explaining what they are and how they can help.

### Occupational Therapy (OT)

*   **What is it?** Occupational Therapists help people participate in the "occupations" of daily life. This includes everything from self-care (like dressing and showering) to work, hobbies, and social activities.
*   **Who is it for?** People who have difficulty with everyday tasks due to aging, disability, injury, or illness.
*   **How can it help?** An OT can assess your home for safety, recommend assistive technology (like grab rails or walkers), and teach you new ways to perform tasks to increase your independence and safety.

### Physiotherapy

*   **What is it?** Physiotherapists are experts in movement and function. They use a combination of exercise, massage, and education to help improve strength, balance, and mobility.
*   **Who is it for?** Individuals recovering from a fall or surgery, or those with chronic conditions that affect movement, like arthritis or Parkinson's disease.
*   **How can it help?** Physiotherapy can reduce pain, improve your ability to walk and move, prevent falls, and increase your overall physical confidence.

### Podiatry

*   **What is it?** Podiatrists diagnose and treat conditions of the feet, ankles, and lower legs.
*   **Who is it for?** Anyone with foot pain, diabetes-related foot complications, difficulty with nail care, or issues with walking and balance caused by their feet.
*   **How can it help?** Regular podiatry care can prevent serious foot problems, relieve pain, improve mobility, and is crucial for managing diabetes.

### Speech Pathology

*   **What is it?** Speech Pathologists assess and treat communication and swallowing disorders.
*   **Who is it for?** People who have difficulty speaking, understanding language, or swallowing safely, often following a stroke or due to a progressive neurological condition.
*   **How can it help?** A Speech Pathologist can help improve communication skills, recommend alternative communication methods, and provide strategies to make eating and drinking safer.

### Dietetics

*   **What is it?** Dietitians are experts in food and nutrition. They provide advice on how to eat to improve your health and manage medical conditions.
*   **Who is it for?** Individuals who need to manage their diet for conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or malnutrition, or those who have difficulty chewing or swallowing.
*   **How can it help?** A Dietitian can create a personalised eating plan to improve your energy levels, manage your weight, and ensure you're getting the nutrients your body needs to stay healthy.

Most of these services can be accessed in your own home through a Home Care Package or as part of your NDIS plan.
