<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
Navigating the aged care system can feel overwhelming, especially when you're worried about how to pay for it without significant assets. Many Australian pensioners share this concern, fearing they won't be able to afford the quality care they need. This guide is here to put those fears to rest. We'll walk you through the exact steps to access government-funded aged care, explain how costs are determined, and show you that a secure future is absolutely possible, even with no assets.

<!-- ADDRESS THE CORE QUESTION (H2) -->
## Can You Get Aged Care in Australia With No Assets?

Yes, you can absolutely get aged care in Australia if you have no assets. The Australian government has systems in place, including financial hardship provisions, to ensure that everyone can access the care they need, regardless of their financial situation. You will not be denied care because you don't own a home or have large savings.

## Step-by-Step Guide: How to Get Care as a Pensioner with No Assets

The process is managed through My Aged Care and Centrelink. Here's how it works.

### Step 1: The My Aged Care Assessment
First, you need an assessment to determine your care needs. This isn't about your finances; it's about understanding what support you require.

1.  **Contact My Aged Care:** You can call them on **1800 200 422** or apply for an assessment online through the [My Aged Care website](https://www.myagedcare.gov.au).
2.  **Assessment:** A trained assessor will either visit you at home or speak with you over the phone to understand your daily life and challenges.

### Step 2: The Centrelink Means Test (Income Assessment)
Because you have no assets, your assessment will focus solely on your income. This is used to determine how much you may need to contribute to your care costs.

1.  **Complete the Form:** Services Australia will provide you with a form to detail your income. You can find more information on their [means assessment page](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/health-and-wellbeing/aged-care/means-assessment).
2.  **Pensioner Status:** As a pensioner, your income details are already known to Centrelink, which often simplifies the process.

### Step 3: Finding a Provider
Once your assessments are complete, you can start looking for a home care provider or a residential aged care home that meets your needs. The My Aged Care website has a "Find a Provider" tool to help you.

## Demystifying the Costs: What You'll Actually Pay

Even with no assets, you will be asked to contribute to the cost of your care based on your income. Here's a breakdown of the fees.

| Fee Type | Who Pays It | How It's Calculated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basic Daily Fee** | Everyone | A percentage of the single person's basic Age Pension. As of July 2025, this is around 85%. |
| **Means-Tested Care Fee** | Some people | Based on the outcome of your income assessment. There are annual and lifetime caps on this fee. |
| **Accommodation Costs** | Depends on assessment | If you have no assets, the government will pay your accommodation costs in full. You will be a **fully supported resident**. |

## Frequently Asked Questions

We've searched forums and communities to find what people are most worried about. Here are the answers to your most pressing questions.

### What if I can't afford the fees?
If you face financial hardship, you can apply for assistance. The government's [financial hardship provisions](https://www.myagedcare.gov.au/income-and-means-assessments) can help reduce or cover your fees for a period of time. You won't be denied care because you can't pay.

### Will I lose my pension?
No, entering aged care does not mean you lose your pension. However, the amount you receive might change depending on your new living situation and the fees you pay.

### What are my rights in aged care?
You have the right to be treated with dignity and respect, and to receive quality care. The [Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission](https://www.agedcarequality.gov.au) is the national regulator that protects your rights.

### Am I a burden on my family?
This is a common fear, but the Australian aged care system is designed to prevent this. It is structured so that individuals are supported by the government based on their own means, not their family's. Seeking care is about ensuring your own health and safety.

<!-- CONCLUSION & CTA (NO HEADER) -->
