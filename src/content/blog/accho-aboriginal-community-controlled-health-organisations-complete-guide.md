## What is an ACCHO?

An **Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (ACCHO)** is a primary health care service initiated and operated by the local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. These organisations deliver holistic, comprehensive, and culturally appropriate health care to the communities they serve.

> **Key Definition**: ACCHOs are controlled through a locally elected Board of Management, ensuring that health services reflect the needs, values, and cultural practices of the community.

ACCHOs are fundamentally different from mainstream health services because they are:

| Feature | ACCHO | Mainstream Health Service |
|---------|-------|---------------------------|
| Governance | Community-controlled board | Government or corporate |
| Staff | Majority Aboriginal workforce | Variable |
| Cultural approach | Embedded in all services | Often an add-on |
| Service model | Holistic, whole-person care | Often single-issue focused |
| Social determinants | Actively addressed | Typically not in scope |

The ACCHO model recognises that health extends beyond physical wellbeing to include social, emotional, cultural, and spiritual dimensions. This aligns with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander concepts of health that emphasise connection to community, Country, and culture.

## History of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health

### The Birth of the First ACCHO (1971)

The Aboriginal Community Controlled Health movement began in **Redfern, Sydney, in 1971** when Aboriginal community activists established the first Aboriginal Medical Service (AMS).

**Key founders included:**
- Gordon Briscoe
- Mum Shirl (Shirley Smith)
- Dulcie Flower
- Dr Fred Hollows
- Paul Coe
- Ken Brindle
- Chicka and Elsa Dixon

> The service was established without government funding to address blatant discrimination experienced in mainstream services and the ill health and premature deaths of Aboriginal people.

The Redfern AMS was inspired by the success of the Aboriginal Legal Service and opened in a shopfront on Regent Street. It provided a model for Aboriginal communities across Australia to establish their own community-controlled health services.

### Growth of the Movement

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1971 | First AMS established in Redfern |
| 1976 | National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation formed |
| 1992 | Organisation renamed NACCHO |
| 2008 | Over 60 ACCHOs in NSW alone |
| 2012 | 150 ACCHOs operating nationally |
| 2025 | 148 ACCHOs across 550+ sites serving 410,000 people |

The movement demonstrated that community-controlled services could deliver better health outcomes for Aboriginal people. Today, NACCHO (National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation) is a major employer with over 6,000 staff, more than 3,500 of whom are First Nations people.

## ACCHOs and NDIS Disability Services

### The Connection Between ACCHOs and NDIS

Many ACCHOs are now registered NDIS providers, delivering culturally safe disability supports to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Australian Government has funded NACCHO to increase the capacity of ACCHOs to deliver NDIS services, particularly in remote areas.

> **Important**: Research shows that First Nations NDIS participants are 28% less likely to receive care via the NDIS than non-Indigenous Australians. ACCHOs help bridge this gap by providing culturally safe navigation and support.

### Aboriginal Disability Liaison Officers (ADLOs)

There are **over 50 Aboriginal Disability Liaison Officers (ADLOs)** working across **40+ ACCHOs** nationally. These officers:

- Provide culturally safe support throughout the NDIS process
- Assist with NDIS plan development and applications
- Connect clients with local service providers
- Advocate for appropriate culturally safe services
- Help families understand NDIS entitlements

### How ACCHOs Make NDIS Culturally Safe

| Aspect | What ACCHOs Provide |
|--------|---------------------|
| Community governance | Local Aboriginal boards ensure services reflect community values |
| Aboriginal workforce | Staff understand cultural protocols and communication styles |
| Holistic approach | NDIS goals linked with health, housing, and cultural needs |
| Navigation support | Help understanding complex NDIS bureaucracy |
| Family inclusion | Services incorporate kinship and community support |
| Cultural communication | Use of local languages and yarning-based conversations |
| Co-located services | Disability support delivered alongside primary health |

### NDIS Ready Program

NACCHO has delivered over **$1.25 million in grants** to 57 Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisations through the NDIS Ready program to support the delivery of culturally safe NDIS services.

---

## How to Access ACCHO Services

### Who Can Access ACCHO Services?

ACCHOs primarily serve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. You do not need to be on an NDIS plan to access general health services at an ACCHO.

### Steps to Access Care

1. **Find your nearest ACCHO** using the directory above or visit [naccho.org.au/locations](https://www.naccho.org.au/locations/)
2. **Call the clinic** to make an appointment or ask about walk-in availability
3. **Bring your Medicare card** if you have one (most services are bulk-billed)
4. **Complete registration** as a new patient if required

### What to Expect

- Culturally safe, respectful care
- Aboriginal health workers and staff
- Holistic assessment of health and social needs
- Connection to other services if needed
- No judgement, no racism

### Cost of Services

Most ACCHO services are **bulk-billed** under Medicare for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients, meaning there is typically no out-of-pocket cost. Some services may have different arrangements.
