# NDIS Capacity Building Supports 2026: Complete Guide to All 9 Categories

## Key Points

- **Capacity Building** is one of three NDIS budget types (alongside Core and Capital)
- **9 support categories** fall under Capacity Building, each funding different supports
- **Focus on skills** - CB funding helps you build independence, not just provide care
- **Usually stated** - most CB funding is allocated to specific purposes (not flexible)
- **Time-limited goal** - CB supports aim to reduce your need for ongoing assistance

---

## What is NDIS Capacity Building?

Capacity Building (CB) is one of the three main budget types in your NDIS plan. While Core supports fund your day-to-day care needs and Capital funds equipment and modifications, Capacity Building funds supports that help you build skills and increase your independence over time.

### Capacity Building vs Core vs Capital

| Budget Type | Purpose | Examples | Flexibility |
|-------------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Core Supports** | Daily living assistance | Support workers, transport, consumables | Usually flexible across categories |
| **Capacity Building** | Skill development | Therapy, support coordination, employment support | Usually stated (specific purpose) |
| **Capital Supports** | Equipment and modifications | Wheelchairs, home modifications, AT | Strictly stated |

### The Goal of Capacity Building

The purpose of CB funding is to help you develop skills and independence so you need less support over time. For example:

- Occupational therapy to learn cooking skills (CB) vs a support worker cooking for you (Core)
- Employment support to find a job (CB) vs ongoing support at work (Core)
- Social skills training (CB) vs support worker accompanying you to events (Core)

### What It Funds

## How Capacity Building Budget Works

### Stated vs Flexible Funding

Most Capacity Building funding is **stated**, meaning it's allocated to a specific purpose:

| Budget Type | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Stated** | Allocated to specific category | "$5,000 for Support Coordination" |
| **Flexible** | Can move between categories | Rare in CB - more common in Core |

### What This Means for You

If you have $10,000 in Improved Daily Living and $3,000 in Support Coordination:

- You cannot move money from therapy to support coordination (or vice versa)
- Each allocation must be used for its stated purpose
- Unused funds don't automatically transfer to other categories

### Under PACE (New System)

The PACE system provides more flexibility within categories. You may have broader category budgets rather than line-by-line allocations, giving you more choice in how you use your CB funding.

---

## Maximising Your Capacity Building Budget

### 1. Understand Your Allocations

Review your plan to understand:

- How much CB funding you have
- Which categories it's allocated to
- What goals it's meant to address

### 2. Choose Appropriate Providers

- Shop around for competitive rates within price limits
- Consider group programs which often cost less than individual sessions
- Ask about therapy assistant rates for follow-up support

### 3. Focus on Skill Transfer

The goal of CB is independence. Ensure your providers:

- Teach you skills (not just do things for you)
- Involve your support workers in training
- Provide strategies you can use independently

### 4. Track Your Progress

Document how CB supports help you:

- Before and after capability measures
- Goals achieved and skills learned
- Reduced need for other supports

This evidence supports future CB funding in plan reviews.

## Common Questions About Capacity Building

### Can I use Capacity Building funding for support workers?

Generally no. Support workers are funded through Core Supports (Assistance with Daily Life). CB funding is specifically for skill development, therapy, and training.

Exception: Some CB funding (like SLES or behaviour support) may include worker time for specific skill-building activities.

### What if I don't use all my CB funding?

Unused CB funding doesn't automatically roll over. If you consistently under-use a category, future plans may allocate less. Speak with your Support Coordinator about using your full allocation.

### Can I change how my CB funding is allocated?

You can request a plan review if your CB allocations don't match your needs. Document why different allocations would better meet your goals.

### Do I need a referral for CB services?

You don't need a medical referral to use most NDIS-funded CB services. However, your plan must include the relevant CB category.
