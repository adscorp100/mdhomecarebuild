# NDIS Goals Examples 2026: 50+ SMART Goal Ideas for Your Plan

## Key Points

- **SMART goals** are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound
- **Focus on outcomes** - what you want to achieve, not the services you need
- **Goals drive funding** - well-written goals help secure appropriate supports
- **Review regularly** - goals should be reviewed at each plan meeting
- **Be honest** - goals should reflect your real aspirations and challenges

---

## What Are NDIS Goals?

NDIS goals are statements about what you want to achieve with support from your NDIS plan. Good goals help the NDIA understand what matters to you and what supports you need to live the life you want.

Your goals influence:

- What funding you receive
- What types of supports are included in your plan
- How your progress is measured
- What your plan reviews focus on

### Why SMART Goals Matter

Vague goals like "I want to be more independent" don't give the NDIA enough information to fund appropriate supports. SMART goals are:

| Element | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Specific** | Clearly defined outcome | "Learn to cook 5 simple meals" |
| **Measurable** | Can track progress | "Cook independently 3 times per week" |
| **Achievable** | Realistic with support | "With OT training over 6 months" |
| **Relevant** | Matters to your life | "So I can live in my own apartment" |
| **Time-bound** | Has a deadline | "By the end of my plan period" |

## How to Write Your Own Goals

### Step 1: Start with What Matters

Ask yourself:

- What would I like to be doing in 12 months that I can't do now?
- What activities would make my life better?
- What challenges do I face that support could address?
- What are my dreams for the future?

### Step 2: Make It Specific

Transform your wish into a specific outcome:

| Wish | Specific Goal |
|------|---------------|
| "Be more independent" | "Cook dinner independently twice per week" |
| "Get out more" | "Attend the local library once per week" |
| "Make friends" | "Join a social group and attend monthly" |

### Step 3: Add Measurable Elements

How will you know you've achieved it?

- How often will you do the activity?
- What level of support will you have?
- What will success look like?

### Step 4: Check It's Achievable

Consider:

- Is this realistic with the right supports?
- Do I have the foundation skills needed?
- What barriers might I face?

### Step 5: Set a Timeframe

- What can you achieve in 3 months?
- What about 6 months? 12 months?
- Be realistic about learning curves

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Writing Service-Based Goals

**Wrong:** "I want 10 hours of support worker per week"

**Right:** "I want to access my local community independently, requiring support worker assistance initially reducing over 12 months"

### Being Too Vague

**Wrong:** "I want to be happy"

**Right:** "I want to participate in activities I enjoy and build friendships that support my mental wellbeing"

### Setting Unrealistic Goals

**Wrong:** "I will run a marathon in 3 months" (if you currently use a wheelchair)

**Right:** "I will improve my upper body strength and wheelchair mobility to participate in a wheelchair sport within 12 months"

### Forgetting to Include All Life Areas

Your NDIS plan should cover multiple life areas, not just one. Consider goals across:

- Daily living and independence
- Social and community participation
- Employment or meaningful activity
- Health and wellbeing
- Housing and living arrangements
- Relationships and connections

## FAQs About NDIS Goals

### How many goals should I have?

Most plans have 3-6 goals covering different life areas. Quality matters more than quantity.

### Can I change my goals?

Yes. You can request a plan review if your goals change significantly, or update them at your scheduled plan reassessment.

### Who helps me write goals?

Your Support Coordinator, Local Area Coordinator (LAC), or a trusted family member can help. You can also prepare goals before your planning meeting.

### Do goals affect my funding?

Yes. Goals that require specific supports (like employment support or therapy) help justify funding for those supports.

### What if I don't achieve my goals?

That's okay. Goals can be adjusted. What matters is that you're working toward meaningful outcomes. Partial progress is still progress.
