Supported Independent Living (SIL) and Specialist Level of Everyday Support (SLES) are specialized NDIS funding categories that provide intensive support for people with significant disabilities to live independently in the community. These services offer 24/7 or high-intensity support in shared or individual accommodation settings.

## What is SIL NDIS Funding?

Supported Independent Living (SIL) is NDIS funding that covers the cost of daily personal care and support for people with significant disabilities who need assistance with everyday activities. SIL funding is separate from accommodation costs and focuses purely on the support services needed to live independently.

### Key Features of SIL NDIS Support:
- **24/7 support availability** for participants with high needs
- **Personal care assistance** including bathing, dressing, and medication
- **Daily living support** such as meal preparation and household tasks
- **Community access support** to maintain social connections
- **Skill development** to increase independence over time
- **Shared or individual support** depending on needs and preferences

SIL is funded under the Core Supports category of NDIS plans and is one of the most intensive support types available through the scheme.

## What is SLES NDIS Funding?

Specialist Level of Everyday Support (SLES) is temporary, intensive NDIS funding designed to help participants build skills and confidence to transition to more independent living arrangements. SLES provides higher levels of support for a limited time period.

### SLES NDIS Support Includes:
- **Intensive skill building** in daily living activities
- **Behavior support** for complex needs
- **Transition planning** to less intensive support
- **Crisis intervention** and stabilization support
- **Family and carer training** where appropriate
- **Goal-focused interventions** with measurable outcomes

SLES is typically funded for 12-24 months and is designed to achieve specific goals that increase a participant's independence.

## Frequently Asked Questions About SIL and SLES NDIS

### How much SIL funding can I get from NDIS?
SIL funding ranges from $80,000 to over $320,000 annually depending on your support needs. Low support SIL typically provides $80,000-120,000, medium support $120,000-200,000, and high support $200,000-320,000+. The exact amount depends on your functional capacity assessment, level of disability, and specific support requirements.

### What's the difference between SIL and SLES?
SIL (Supported Independent Living) provides ongoing daily support for people with significant disabilities to live independently. SLES (Specialist Level of Everyday Support) is temporary intensive support (typically 12-24 months) focused on building skills and transitioning to more independent arrangements. SIL is ongoing, while SLES has specific goals and timeframes.

### How long does SLES funding last?
SLES funding typically lasts 12-24 months, though duration varies based on individual goals and progress. Transitional SLES usually runs 12-18 months, crisis SLES 6-12 months, and specialized SLES 18-24 months. Extensions may be possible if participants need additional time to achieve their independence goals.

### Can I choose my own SIL provider?
Yes, you have the right to choose your SIL provider from any NDIS-registered provider that offers SIL services. You can research providers, visit their facilities, meet staff, and select the one that best matches your preferences, support needs, and accommodation requirements. You can also change providers if you're not satisfied.

### What does SIL funding cover?
SIL funding covers support services including personal care assistance, help with daily living activities, medication management, community access support, and 24/7 supervision if needed. It does NOT cover accommodation costs (rent), food, utilities, or personal items. Accommodation costs are covered separately through Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) funding or private rental.

### How do I apply for SIL or SLES funding?
To apply for SIL or SLES, request an NDIS plan review with your planner or Local Area Coordinator. You'll need functional capacity assessments, medical reports, therapy assessments, and documentation of your current support arrangements. The NDIS will assess your eligibility based on your support needs and goals.

### Can I live alone with SIL funding?
Yes, SIL funding can support individual living arrangements, though it's more expensive than shared arrangements. Individual SIL support provides 1:1 assistance based on your specific needs and can range from a few hours daily to 24/7 support depending on your functional capacity and safety requirements.

### What happens if my SIL or SLES provider is unsatisfactory?
If you're unsatisfied with your provider, you can raise concerns directly with them, contact the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, or change providers. You have the right to quality services and can terminate agreements with reasonable notice. The NDIS can help you find alternative providers if needed.
