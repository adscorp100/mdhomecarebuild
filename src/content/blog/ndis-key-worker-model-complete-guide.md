## Key Points

- **A key worker** is a single trusted professional who coordinates all your child's NDIS supports
- **One point of contact** - instead of juggling multiple therapists, you have one person who manages everything
- **Common for children** - key workers are especially valuable in Early Childhood Early Intervention (ECEI)
- **They deliver AND coordinate** - unlike support coordinators, key workers can provide therapy directly
- **Family-centred** - good key workers support the whole family, not just your child

---

If you've just entered the NDIS for your child, you may have heard about "key workers" and wondered what they do. Put simply, a key worker is the one person who helps make sense of everything - coordinating your child's therapies, communicating with all the providers, and being there when you have questions.

This guide explains what a key worker does, how to find one, and what to expect from the relationship.

## What is a Key Worker in the NDIS?

A key worker is the single professional who becomes your main point of contact for your child's NDIS supports. Instead of you coordinating between the speech therapist, OT, and physio, your key worker handles that coordination - while often providing therapy directly themselves.

Think of them as your child's "team captain" who makes sure everyone is working towards the same goals.

### What Your Key Worker Does

| What They Do | How This Helps Your Family |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| **Coordinates all therapies** | You don't have to chase multiple providers or repeat information |
| **Delivers therapy directly** | They know your child well and can provide consistent support |
| **Communicates with the whole team** | Speech, OT, physio all work together, not in isolation |
| **Tracks your child's progress** | You get clear updates on how your child is developing |
| **Prepares for plan reviews** | They document everything you need for your next NDIS review |
| **Answers your questions** | One phone call, one email - they know your child's full picture |
| **Supports you as parents** | Good key workers help the whole family, not just your child |

### Where You'll Find Key Workers

Key workers are most commonly part of:
- **Early childhood intervention services** (ECEI partners and providers)
- **Allied health practices** offering paediatric services
- **Community-based disability services**
- **Multi-disciplinary therapy centres**
- **Some NDIS-registered providers**

## Key Worker vs Support Coordinator: What's the Difference?

This is one of the most common questions parents have. Both roles involve coordination, but they work quite differently.

| | Key Worker | Support Coordinator |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| **Main role** | Delivers AND coordinates your child's therapies | Helps you navigate the NDIS system and find providers |
| **Provides therapy?** | Yes - often delivers therapy directly | No - connects you to therapists but doesn't provide therapy |
| **How many families?** | Smaller caseload (5-15 families) for intensive work | Larger caseload (20-30+ participants) |
| **Relationship** | Deep, ongoing - really gets to know your child | Advisory - helps with the big picture and paperwork |
| **Who are they?** | Usually allied health professionals (OT, speech, physio) | Case managers, social workers |

### Which Does Your Child Need?

**A key worker is best when:**
- Your child needs multiple therapies that should work together
- You want one person who deeply understands your child
- Early intervention is the focus
- You're juggling too many appointments and providers

**A support coordinator is best when:**
- You mainly need help understanding and using your NDIS plan
- You need to find and choose providers
- Your child's supports are straightforward
- You need help with plan reviews and budgeting

> **Many families have both:** A [support coordinator](/blog/what-does-a-support-coordinator-do-in-the-ndis) for plan-level help and a key worker for day-to-day therapy coordination. Talk to your LAC about what's right for your situation.

## What Type of Professional Will Be Your Key Worker?

Your child's key worker could be one of several different professionals, depending on your child's needs and what's available in your area.

### Common Key Worker Professionals

| Professional | Best For |
|--------------|----------|
| **Occupational Therapist (OT)** | Children who need help with daily living skills, sensory processing, or fine motor development |
| **Speech Pathologist** | Children with communication challenges, speech delays, or feeding difficulties |
| **Physiotherapist** | Children with physical or movement challenges, gross motor development |
| **Early Childhood Educator** | Young children (0-6) needing developmental support across multiple areas |
| **Psychologist** | Children with behavioural challenges, autism, or complex needs |
| **Social Worker** | Families needing strong advocacy and system navigation alongside therapy |

The most important thing isn't their profession - it's that they have experience with children like yours and that you feel comfortable working with them.

### What Makes a Good Key Worker?

When you're looking for a key worker, look for someone who:

- **Listens to you** - takes time to understand your family's situation and priorities
- **Communicates clearly** - explains things in plain language, not jargon
- **Is responsive** - returns calls and emails in reasonable timeframes
- **Involves you** - teaches you strategies to use at home, doesn't just "do therapy"
- **Coordinates well** - actually talks to other providers, not just sends reports
- **Is flexible** - adjusts their approach based on what's working for your child

## What to Expect When Working With a Key Worker

Here's what the key worker journey typically looks like for families:

### Getting Started

1. **You contact a provider** that offers key worker services (your LAC or support coordinator can help you find one)
2. **Initial assessment** - the provider meets with you to understand your child's needs
3. **Key worker assigned** - you're matched with a professional suited to your child
4. **First meeting** - your key worker meets with you and your child to build rapport

### The First Few Weeks

| What Happens | What You Should Expect |
|--------------|------------------------|
| **Getting to know your child** | Key worker observes, assesses, and starts to understand your child's strengths and challenges |
| **Understanding your priorities** | They ask what matters most to you and what your family goals are |
| **Reviewing your NDIS plan** | They look at your [goals](/blog/ndis-goals-examples-smart-planning-guide) and funding to plan services |
| **Creating a therapy plan** | They develop a schedule of supports that works for your family |

### Ongoing Support

Once established, your key worker will typically:

- **Meet with your child regularly** - weekly or fortnightly depending on needs
- **Coordinate other therapies** - make sure all providers are working together
- **Keep you updated** - regular progress updates (ask how often and in what format)
- **Teach you home strategies** - so you can support your child between sessions
- **Adjust as needed** - if something isn't working, they'll adapt the approach

### Plan Review Time

When your NDIS plan review approaches, your key worker will:

- Document all the progress your child has made
- Prepare reports showing how funding was used
- Help you think about what goals to set for the next plan
- Support you in the review meeting if needed

> **Related:** Understanding your [NDIS plan management options](/blog/ndis-plan-manager-complete-guide) can help you make the most of your key worker's support.

## Early Childhood Key Workers (ECEI)

If your child is under 9 and accessing early intervention, the key worker model is especially important. Young children's development is rapid, and having one person coordinate everything makes a real difference.

### What Early Childhood Key Workers Focus On

| Focus Area | What This Means for Your Child |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| **Developmental milestones** | Helping your child reach their developmental potential across all areas |
| **Play-based learning** | Using play to build skills naturally and engagingly |
| **Coaching you as parents** | Teaching you strategies so therapy continues at home |
| **Kindy and school readiness** | Preparing for transitions to childcare, kindergarten, or school |
| **Coordinated therapies** | Making sure speech, OT, and physio all work towards the same goals |

### What Makes ECEI Key Workers Different?

Early childhood key workers are specifically trained to work with young children and families. They understand that:

- **Parents are the experts** on their own child
- **Natural environments** (home, playground, kindy) are where learning happens best
- **Whole-family support** is essential - they help the whole household, not just your child
- **Early years matter** - intensive early support can change your child's trajectory

### Is an ECEI Key Worker Right for Your Child?

The ECEI key worker approach is particularly valuable when:

- Your child is under 7 and newly accessing the NDIS
- You want one trusted professional coordinating everything
- You need practical strategies to use at home every day
- Your child has multiple therapy needs (not just one area)
- You're preparing for the transition to school

> **Not sure about ECEI eligibility?** Our [NDIS eligibility guide](/blog/ndis-eligibility-requirements-complete-guide) explains the early intervention pathway for young children.

### How the Thriving Kids Program May Affect Key Workers

From October 2025, the Australian Government's Thriving Kids program will provide a new support pathway for children under 9 with low to moderate developmental needs. As Thriving Kids rolls out fully by January 2028, the key worker model may evolve to serve families across both the NDIS and the new program. Children with high support needs will remain on the NDIS, so key worker services for those families will continue unchanged. If your child has lower support needs, it is worth discussing with your key worker how the transition to Thriving Kids might affect your current arrangements.

## Benefits of the Key Worker Model

### For Your Child

| Benefit | What This Means |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Better progress** | One person focused on your child's outcomes, not just hours of service |
| **Consistent care** | Same therapist who really knows your child, not a rotating roster |
| **Coordinated therapy** | All services working together toward the same goals |
| **Smoother transitions** | Someone to manage changes (new kindy, new school, etc.) |

### For You as Parents

| Benefit | What This Means |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Less admin burden** | No more coordinating between 4 different providers yourself |
| **One point of contact** | One person to call when you have questions |
| **Practical home strategies** | Learn techniques you can use every day |
| **Expert guidance** | Someone who knows your child can help you make decisions |

### What Research Shows

Studies on the key worker model show:
- **85% of families** report less administrative burden
- **92% parent satisfaction** in early childhood key worker programs
- Children with key workers show **better developmental outcomes** than those with fragmented services

## How Key Workers Are Funded in Your NDIS Plan

The good news: key worker services are funded through your NDIS plan - there's no out-of-pocket cost if you have appropriate funding.

### Where the Funding Comes From

| Your Child's Situation | Funding Category |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| **Child under 9 in early intervention** | Early Childhood Early Intervention (ECEI) funding |
| **Therapy services (OT, speech, physio)** | Capacity Building - Improved Daily Living ([CB Daily Activity](/blog/ndis-improved-daily-living-cb-daily-activity-guide)) |
| **Direct support activities** | Core Supports |

### What to Check in Your Plan

Look at your NDIS plan to see if you have funding in:
- **CB Daily Activity** (sometimes called "Improved Daily Living") - this is where most therapy and key worker services come from
- **Core Supports** - some coordination activities may be funded here
- **ECEI** - if your child is under 9, funding may be structured differently

## How to Find a Key Worker for Your Child

### Where to Start

1. **Ask your LAC or support coordinator** - they can recommend key worker providers in your area
2. **Ask other parents** - local disability support groups often share provider recommendations
3. **Contact ECEI partners** - if your child is under 9, your ECEI partner can connect you with key worker services
4. **Search the NDIS provider finder** - look for allied health providers offering coordination

### Questions to Ask When Meeting Providers

Before you commit to a key worker, it's worth having a conversation. Here are questions to ask:

**About them:**
- How long have you been working as a key worker?
- What experience do you have with children like mine?
- How many families are you currently working with?

**About how they work:**
- How often would we see you? Where (home, clinic, kindy)?
- How will you communicate with me between sessions?
- How do you coordinate with other therapists?
- What happens if you're sick or go on leave?

**About your child's progress:**
- How will I know my child is making progress?
- How often will you give me updates?
- What does your reporting look like for plan reviews?

**About your involvement:**
- How do you involve parents in therapy?
- Will you teach me strategies to use at home?

### Red Flags to Watch For

Be cautious if a potential key worker:
- Won't give you straight answers about their experience
- Seems dismissive of your concerns or priorities
- Doesn't want to communicate with other providers
- Can't explain how they'll measure progress
- Isn't willing to adapt their approach to your family

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a key worker for my child?

Not everyone needs a key worker, but they're particularly valuable when your child has multiple therapy needs that should work together. If you're juggling OT, speech, and physio appointments yourself and feeling overwhelmed, a key worker can take that coordination off your plate.

### What's the difference between a key worker and a support coordinator?

A **key worker** provides therapy AND coordinates all your child's services - they're a hands-on therapist who knows your child deeply. A **[support coordinator](/blog/what-does-a-support-coordinator-do-in-the-ndis)** helps you navigate the NDIS system and find providers, but doesn't provide therapy themselves.

Many families have both: a support coordinator for plan-level help and a key worker for day-to-day therapy coordination.

### Is the key worker model only for children?

No. While key workers are especially common in early childhood intervention (ECEI), the model works for participants of all ages, particularly those with complex needs requiring multiple therapies.

### How much does a key worker cost?

Key worker services are funded through your NDIS plan. If you have CB Daily Activity (therapy) funding, there's no out-of-pocket cost. Check your plan to see what's available.

### Can I choose my own key worker?

Generally yes. If the first key worker assigned doesn't feel like a good fit, you can ask to try someone else. The relationship matters - you need someone you trust and can communicate openly with.

### What if our key worker leaves?

Good providers will have a transition plan. Ask about this upfront: "What happens if our key worker goes on maternity leave or leaves the organisation?" The answer will tell you a lot about how well-managed the service is.

### Can we change key workers if it's not working?

Yes. If the relationship isn't working after giving it a fair chance (usually a few months), you can request a different key worker or find a new provider. Your child's progress is what matters most.

3. **Key worker training** - NDIS-approved programs available through NDS and other providers
4. **Clearances** - NDIS Worker Screening Check, police check, Working With Children Check

Key worker certification typically requires renewal every 2 years through refresher training.
