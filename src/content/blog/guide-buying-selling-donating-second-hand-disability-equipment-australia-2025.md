# The Ultimate Guide to Buying, Selling & Donating Second-Hand Disability Equipment in Australia [Updated 2025]

## 1. Introduction: Accessing Affordable Disability Equipment in Australia

Acquiring new disability equipment and mobility aids often represents a significant financial outlay for many Australians.<sup>1</sup> Fortunately, the second-hand market offers a viable and cost-effective alternative, enabling individuals to access necessary equipment without the substantial expense of brand-new items. This comprehensive guide serves as a central resource for navigating the process of buying, selling, and donating used disability equipment across Australia.

The focus extends beyond simply finding items; it delves into crucial considerations such as safety checks, understanding the implications of National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) funding, and identifying reputable sources for these transactions. Engaging with the second-hand market presents a dual advantage: buyers can achieve considerable savings, while sellers can recoup some of their initial costs or ensure their no-longer-needed equipment benefits someone else.<sup>2</sup> This approach also fosters sustainability by reducing waste and promoting a circular economy within the healthcare sector.

The primary motivation for exploring the second-hand market is often affordability.<sup>1</sup> However, this financial benefit must be carefully balanced against potential risks related to safety, hygiene, and the suitability of the equipment.<sup>4</sup> Establishing trust and providing reliable information is paramount, especially given the health-related nature of these products. The landscape of available platforms, including numerous online marketplaces and community groups, can appear fragmented.<sup>6</sup> This guide aims to consolidate these options, offering clarity and actionable advice to empower users.

This resource is designed to be the most thorough, trustworthy, and search-optimised guide available, addressing the needs of Australians seeking information on "second hand disability equipment," "used mobility aids," and related terms for buying and selling within Australia.

## 2. Weighing the Options: Benefits vs. Risks of Second-Hand Disability Equipment

Choosing between new and second-hand disability equipment involves evaluating a trade-off between cost savings and potential risks. Understanding both sides is crucial for making an informed decision that prioritizes both budget and well-being.

### 2.1 The Advantages (Beyond Cost)

The most apparent benefit of opting for second-hand equipment is the potential for significant cost savings compared to purchasing new items.<sup>1</sup> Depreciation on mobility aids and medical equipment can be substantial, similar to vehicles, meaning used items are often available at a fraction of their original price.<sup>9</sup>

Beyond the financial aspect, choosing used equipment contributes positively to the environment. It reduces manufacturing demand and keeps functional items out of landfill, supporting a more sustainable approach to resource consumption.<sup>2</sup>

In some cases, purchasing second-hand can also mean faster access to equipment. Wait times for new, particularly custom-ordered, items can sometimes be lengthy. The second-hand market might offer immediate availability. Furthermore, it can occasionally be a source for finding specific older or discontinued models that might perfectly suit a user's unique needs or preferences, which are no longer available new.

### 2.2 Potential Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

While the benefits are attractive, prospective buyers must be aware of the potential downsides associated with second-hand disability equipment.

*   **Safety & Reliability:** Used equipment inherently carries a risk of being worn, damaged, or prone to malfunction.<sup>4</sup> Damage might not always be visible, especially internal weaknesses caused by previous impacts.<sup>5</sup> Assessing the true condition and history can be difficult <sup>10</sup>, potentially leading to safety hazards if the equipment fails during use.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Thorough pre-purchase inspections (detailed in Section 6) and seeking advice from qualified professionals (like Occupational Therapists or Physiotherapists) are essential.
*   **Hygiene Concerns:** Items used personally, such as commodes, shower chairs, or mattresses, present obvious hygiene challenges.<sup>4</sup> Inadequate cleaning can pose health risks, particularly for individuals with compromised immune systems.<sup>4</sup>
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implementing rigorous cleaning and sanitisation procedures (see Section 6) is non-negotiable for such items.
*   **Suitability & Fit:** Disability equipment often needs to be tailored to an individual's specific measurements, condition, and functional requirements. A second-hand item may not provide the correct fit or support, potentially causing discomfort, reducing effectiveness, or even leading to injury.<sup>4</sup> This is especially true for items like custom wheelchairs or fitted equipment such as stairlifts or hoists, which were originally customised for someone else.<sup>5</sup> Using an inappropriate aid, or using an aid incorrectly, can sometimes cause more harm than good.<sup>11</sup>
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Prioritising assessment by an Occupational Therapist (OT) or Physiotherapist (PT) before purchase is critical to ensure suitability (see Section 6).
*   **Lack of Warranty & Support:** Unlike new products, second-hand items typically do not come with a manufacturer's warranty.<sup>4</sup> If the equipment breaks down, the buyer bears the full responsibility and cost of repairs. Finding replacement parts, especially for older or discontinued models, can be difficult or impossible, potentially rendering the item unusable.<sup>9</sup>
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Buyers should inquire about the item's age, repair history, and the availability of spare parts before committing (see Section 6).
*   **Scams:** Online marketplaces, while convenient, can expose buyers to potential scams, particularly when dealing with unknown private sellers.<sup>13</sup> Misrepresentation of item condition or non-delivery after payment are risks.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilizing reputable platforms, exercising caution, and following platform safety guidelines is advised. Platforms specializing in disability equipment may offer a greater degree of trust.
*   **Consumer Rights:** Purchasing from private sellers offers fewer consumer protections under Australian Consumer Law compared to buying new items from a business.<sup>5</sup> Recourse for faulty goods is significantly limited.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Understanding basic consumer rights and preferring reputable sellers or platforms where possible. Linking to ACCC resources provides further information (see Section 7).

Navigating these potential pitfalls requires diligence. The significant knowledge gap regarding these risks means users might focus solely on cost savings.<sup>4</sup> Explicitly detailing these potential problems, alongside mitigation strategies discussed later, is crucial for building user awareness and trust. The issue of suitability, particularly highlighted by the need for professional assessment <sup>5</sup>, underscores that simply finding a cheap item is insufficient; it must be the right item for the individual's safety and well-being.

## 3. Where to Find Second-Hand Disability Equipment in Australia

The market for used disability equipment in Australia is diverse, offering several avenues for buyers. Knowing where to look and understanding the characteristics of each platform can streamline the search process.

### 3.1 Online Marketplaces & Classifieds

These platforms offer broad reach but vary in specialization.

*   **General Platforms:** Websites like Gumtree <sup>6</sup>, eBay <sup>6</sup>, and Facebook Marketplace <sup>7</sup> list a vast array of items, including disability equipment.
    *   **Pros:** Wide selection, potential for local finds, competitive pricing.
    *   **Cons:** Higher risk of scams, less specific filtering, sellers may lack specialized knowledge, item condition varies greatly.
*   **Specialist Disability Platforms:** Several websites focus specifically on assistive technology and disability equipment.
    *   **eBility:** Frequently mentioned and described as a leading accessible classifieds site with a long history, connecting buyers and sellers of disability equipment, vehicles, and properties.<sup>1</sup>
    *   **MediAids Marketplace:** Another platform dedicated to buying and selling second-hand disability equipment.<sup>6</sup>
    *   **AT Australia Second Hand Register:** A register specifically for second-hand Assistive Technology.<sup>6</sup>
    *   **TAD Equip Second Hand Equipment:** Offered by TAD (Technology for Ageing and Disability) organisations.<sup>6</sup> (e.g., TADACT also refurbishes items <sup>19</sup>).
    *   **Pros:** More relevant listings, potentially more knowledgeable sellers/buyers, potentially higher trust level.
    *   **Cons:** May have fewer listings than general platforms.
*   **Trading Post:** Also listed as a source for mobility aids.<sup>6</sup>

### 3.2 Dedicated Facebook Groups

Online communities can be valuable resources.

*   Specific Australian Facebook groups facilitate buying, selling, and swapping:
    *   "Second-hand equipment for children with disability in Australia" <sup>6</sup>
    *   "Disability Equipment Australia for Sale or Swap" <sup>6</sup>
    *   "Buy and Sell Disability Products Australia - new and used" <sup>6</sup>
    *   "Disability and Special Needs Equipment Australia - Buy, Sell Swap or Free" <sup>6</sup>
*   **Pros:** Community focus, potential for specific item requests, peer-to-peer interaction.
*   **Cons:** Requires Facebook access, variable moderation, potential for scams still exists.

### 3.3 Specialist Retailers & Refurbishers

Some businesses dealing in mobility and disability equipment also offer used or refurbished items. It is important to note that many retailers primarily focus on new equipment sales and NDIS services.<sup>20</sup> However, some explicitly advertise second-hand, clearance, or refurbished stock:

*   Examples include: Statewide Home Health Care (VIC) <sup>21</sup>, ILS (National - check 'Clearance Sale') <sup>23</sup>, Get About Mobility (online - mentions possibility) <sup>15</sup>, Motobility (WA) <sup>26</sup>, Liberty Healthcare (online - 'Clearance') <sup>27</sup>, Westernport Mobility (VIC) <sup>28</sup>, Astley Mobility (NSW - 'Ex Demo') <sup>29</sup>, Mobility Scooters for Hire Sales Service Melbourne (VIC) <sup>30</sup>, Freedom Mobility (VIC) <sup>31</sup>, Mobility Scooters Kingsgrove (NSW - 'Pre-Loved & Refurbished') <sup>32</sup>, Mobile Independence (QLD) <sup>34</sup>, TADACT (ACT - Refurbished) <sup>19</sup>, Blue Sky Healthcare (WA).<sup>35</sup>
*   **Pros:** Items may have undergone some checks or servicing, potential for limited warranties (e.g., 3 months mentioned by <sup>30</sup>), staff may have product knowledge.
*   **Cons:** Selection usually limited, prices may be higher than private sales. Crucially, buyers should always confirm with the retailer if they actually stock used items, as many primarily sell new.

### 3.4 Charities and Non-Profits

Organisations accepting donations (see Section 5) sometimes resell equipment at low cost. The Rotary Aiding Mobility Program (RAMP) is specifically noted for providing donated mobility aids to those in need, often via health professionals.<sup>7</sup>

The variety of channels means users need to weigh the pros and cons based on their priorities, such as budget, urgency, need for inspection, or desired level of trust. Specialist platforms like eBility <sup>1</sup> offer targeted searching, while general platforms like Gumtree <sup>6</sup> provide wider reach. Retailers offering used stock <sup>28</sup> might provide a middle ground with some level of vetting but likely higher prices than private sales.

## 4. Selling Your Unused Disability Equipment in Australia

When disability equipment is no longer needed, selling it can help recoup some of the cost and provide a valuable resource for others. Effectively navigating the selling process involves choosing the right platform and presenting the item honestly.

### 4.1 Where to List Your Items

The same platforms used for buying are generally the primary avenues for selling:

*   **Online Marketplaces & Classifieds:** General sites like Gumtree, eBay, and Facebook Marketplace offer wide exposure.<sup>6</sup>
*   **Specialist Disability Platforms:** Websites like eBility are specifically designed for this purpose and attract a relevant audience.<sup>1</sup> Listing on these platforms can connect sellers with buyers actively seeking disability-specific items.
*   **Dedicated Facebook Groups:** Australian disability equipment buy/sell/swap groups provide a targeted community forum.<sup>6</sup>
*   **Retailers:** While some retailers might buy used equipment or accept trade-ins <sup>15</sup>, this is often less common, and the offered price may be significantly lower than private sales, reflecting the retailer's costs and the typically high depreciation of used equipment.<sup>9</sup>

### 4.2 Tips for a Successful and Safe Sale

Maximising the chances of a sale while ensuring a smooth transaction requires careful preparation and communication:

*   **Honest and Detailed Descriptions:** Transparency is crucial. Provide a comprehensive description including the item's make, model, age, features, dimensions, and weight capacity. Crucially, be upfront about its condition, noting any wear, tear, or known functional issues.<sup>15</sup> In some contexts, there's a legal obligation to disclose known faults in writing when selling second-hand equipment.<sup>10</sup> Honesty builds trust with potential buyers and manages expectations, reducing the likelihood of disputes post-sale.
*   **High-Quality Photos/Videos:** Clear visuals are essential. Include multiple photos showing the item from different angles, highlighting key features and any areas of wear or damage.<sup>15</sup> A short video demonstrating functionality (e.g., a scooter moving, a lift chair operating) can be very effective.<sup>38</sup>
*   **Fair Pricing:** Research what similar items are selling for on the chosen platforms. Be realistic about the value; second-hand equipment depreciates significantly from its new price.<sup>9</sup> Factor in age, condition, and brand reputation. Setting a fair market price increases the likelihood of attracting serious buyers.
*   **Safety During Transaction:** Exercise caution when arranging viewings or exchanges with buyers met online. Choose safe, public meeting locations if possible. Be wary of unusual payment requests. Follow the safety guidelines provided by the selling platform.<sup>13</sup>
*   **NDIS Considerations:** If the equipment was originally purchased using NDIS funding, understand that while you generally own the item and can sell it (see Section 7), transparency is still important. Do not misrepresent the item's funding history.

By providing clear information, pricing fairly, and prioritizing safety, sellers can effectively pass on their unused equipment to someone who needs it. The emphasis on transparency addresses potential buyer skepticism about used goods <sup>9</sup> and aligns with ethical selling practices.

## 5. Giving Back: Donating Used Disability Equipment in Australia

Donating unwanted disability equipment is a generous act that can significantly benefit individuals and communities, while also promoting sustainability. Numerous organisations across Australia facilitate these donations.

### 5.1 The Positive Impact of Donating

Choosing to donate usable equipment rather than discarding it has several positive outcomes:

*   **Supports Individuals in Need:** Donated items provide essential mobility and independence aids to people who might otherwise struggle to afford them.<sup>2</sup>
*   **Aids Charitable Organisations:** Donations support the work of charities and non-profits serving people with disabilities and the aged care sector.<sup>2</sup>
*   **Environmental Responsibility:** Re-using equipment keeps valuable resources in circulation and prevents functional items from ending up in landfill.<sup>2</sup>

### 5.2 Reputable Organisations Accepting Donations

Various organisations accept donations, ranging from large national charities to local community groups. It is crucial to always contact the organisation first to confirm their current needs, acceptance criteria, and drop-off/collection procedures.<sup>17</sup>

*   **National / Multi-State Organisations:**
    *   **Rotary Clubs:** Many clubs participate in programs like RAMP (Rotary Aiding Mobility Program) which collects and distributes mobility aids (wheelchairs, walkers, commodes etc.) locally <sup>7</sup>, or MediShare which sends equipment overseas.<sup>3</sup> Contact local clubs or check specific program details.
    *   **Endeavour Foundation:** Supports people with disabilities and may accept mobility aids; check specific locations.<sup>17</sup>
    *   **The Australian Foundation for Disability (Afford):** A major service provider; acceptance depends on current needs.<sup>17</sup>
    *   **Medicycle:** Operates Australia-wide, facilitating donations of medical equipment (arranges collection, refurbishment).<sup>40</sup>
    *   **Salvation Army / St Vincent de Paul:** May accept mobility aids in good condition; check with local stores.<sup>17</sup>
*   **State-Specific / Regional Organisations:**
    *   **Active Rehabilitation Equipment (Victoria):** Accepts donations of preloved equipment in good working order.<sup>41</sup>
    *   **EnableNSW (New South Wales):** Equipment returned to EnableNSW that isn't reallocated may be donated to NSW Health clinical services, not directly accepted from the public for donation.<sup>42</sup>
    *   **My Way Disability and Aged Care (WA & VIC):** Accepts various items including equipment, furniture, clothing in Perth, Geraldton, Melbourne.<sup>2</sup>
    *   **Sporting Wheelies (Queensland):** Now part of Spinal Life Australia, supports people with disabilities through sport and recreation; may accept relevant equipment.<sup>39</sup>
    *   **TADACT (ACT):** Accepts and refurbishes items like scooters, walkers, bathroom aids.<sup>19</sup>
    *   **Gilani Engineering (NSW):** Primarily a retailer but their website discusses donations, suggesting potential involvement.<sup>17</sup>
*   **Local Options:** Checking directly with local disability support organisations, community health centres, hospitals, or rehabilitation clinics is often effective, as their needs can be immediate and specific.<sup>17</sup> Online platforms like Gumtree's free section or local Facebook groups can also connect donors directly with individuals.<sup>17</sup>

The variety of organisations means donors can often find a suitable recipient relatively close by. Categorising options geographically helps narrow the search.

### 5.3 Preparing Equipment for Donation

To ensure donations are genuinely helpful, follow these guidelines:

*   **Condition:** Items should be in good, clean, and safe working order. Most charities lack the resources to undertake significant repairs.<sup>17</sup> Check for completeness (all parts present).
*   **Cleaning:** Thoroughly clean and sanitise the equipment before donating, especially personal items.<sup>17</sup>
*   **Contact First:** This is the most critical step. Call or check the organisation's website before donating to confirm:
    *   They are currently accepting donations.
    *   They need the specific type of equipment you have.
    *   Their requirements regarding condition, manuals, etc.
    *   Drop-off times and locations or collection arrangements.
    *   This avoids wasted trips for the donor and prevents charities from being burdened with items they cannot use.<sup>17</sup> Include instruction manuals if available.

## 6. Safety First: Your Essential Checklist for Buying Second-Hand

Purchasing second-hand disability equipment requires extra vigilance. While cost savings are appealing, safety, suitability, and hygiene must be paramount to avoid potential harm or discomfort.<sup>4</sup> Unlike new items, used equipment often comes without warranties and with limited consumer protection, especially in private sales.<sup>5</sup>

### 6.1 Why Diligence is Non-Negotiable

The risks associated with used equipment are real. Malfunctions due to wear or hidden damage can lead to falls or other injuries.<sup>4</sup> Equipment that doesn't fit correctly can cause pressure sores, postural problems, or simply be ineffective.<sup>11</sup> Hygiene issues with items like commodes or mattresses can pose infection risks.<sup>4</sup> Therefore, a thorough assessment before purchase is not just recommended, it's essential.

### 6.2 The Pre-Purchase Inspection (Detailed Checklist)

Before finalising a purchase, conduct a detailed physical inspection. If buying online remotely, request comprehensive photos and videos, and ask specific questions based on this checklist.

*   **Structure & Stability:**
    *   Examine the frame for cracks, rust, bends, or stressed welds.
    *   Check overall sturdiness and stability on a level surface.<sup>5</sup> Does it feel solid?
    *   Look for signs of significant impact or previous accidents.<sup>5</sup>
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Test all moving parts thoroughly. Do wheels spin freely and straight? Do castors swivel correctly?
    *   Check brakes: Do they engage firmly and hold? Are cables intact?.<sup>12</sup>
    *   For electric items (scooters, power chairs, beds, hoists): Test controls, motors, and listen for unusual noises. Inquire about battery age and condition, as replacement is costly.<sup>12</sup> Check charger compatibility and function.
    *   Operate any adjustment mechanisms (seat height, backrest angle, armrests, leg rests). Do they lock securely?
    *   Test lifting mechanisms on hoists or standers.
    *   Ensure all parts function as intended.<sup>5</sup>
*   **Wear & Tear:**
    *   Inspect upholstery for rips, tears, or excessive wear.<sup>5</sup> Check padding integrity.
    *   Examine tyres for tread depth and damage (pneumatic tyres offer comfort but can puncture).<sup>12</sup> Check solid tyres for cracks or flat spots.
    *   Look at handgrips, armrests, and footplates for damage or excessive wear.
*   **Completeness:**
    *   Are all essential components present? Any missing parts (e.g., belts, cushions, specific fittings)?.<sup>5</sup>
    *   Are instruction manuals or user guides available? These are important for safe operation and maintenance.<sup>5</sup>
*   **Specific Item Checks (Examples):**
    *   **Wheelchairs:** Check wheel alignment, spoke tension, quick-release axle function, anti-tip wheels.
    *   **Scooters:** Test steering responsiveness, lights, indicators, horn, speed controls.
    *   **Hoists:** Check sling compatibility, spreader bar integrity, emergency stop/lower functions.
    *   **Beds:** Test all motorised functions (head, foot, height adjustment), mattress condition (stains, sagging, suitability for pressure care if needed), side rail function.
*   **Hygiene:**
    *   Assess the overall cleanliness. Are there stains, odours, or visible soiling?.<sup>5</sup>
    *   Pay particular attention to items used for toileting or bathing, and mattresses/cushions. Factor in the cost and effort of professional cleaning if required.<sup>4</sup>

### 6.3 Verifying Compliance and History

Beyond the physical check, investigate the item's background and compliance:

*   **Australian Standards:** Look for labels indicating compliance with relevant Australian Standards (AS/NZS) where applicable.<sup>5</sup> Be cautious with items imported directly from overseas, as they may not meet local standards.<sup>5</sup> Some medical devices should have an Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) number; check if applicable.<sup>5</sup>
*   **Recalls & Bans:** Before buying, check the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) Product Safety Australia website (www.productsafety.gov.au) for any safety recalls or bans related to the product type or specific brand.<sup>5</sup> This is a crucial step to avoid inherently unsafe products.
*   **History & Maintenance:** Ask the seller specific questions <sup>5</sup>:
    *   How old is the item? How heavily was it used?
    *   Has it ever been damaged or involved in an accident?
    *   Have any repairs or modifications been made? By whom? Were genuine parts used?
    *   Is there any remaining warranty (unlikely, but worth asking)?.<sup>5</sup>
    *   What is the manufacturer's stated life expectancy for this type of equipment?.<sup>5</sup>
*   **Repairability:** Can the item still be serviced if needed? Are spare parts available from the original supplier or third parties?.<sup>5</sup>

### 6.4 The Crucial Role of Professional Assessment

Perhaps the most critical safety step, especially for items impacting mobility, posture, or pressure care (like wheelchairs, scooters, hoists, specialised seating, pressure mattresses), is to consult a qualified healthcare professional before purchasing.

*   An Occupational Therapist (OT) or Physiotherapist (PT) can assess the individual's specific clinical needs, functional abilities, and environment.<sup>5</sup>
*   They can determine if the specific second-hand item being considered is appropriate, safe, and correctly configured for the user.<sup>11</sup>
*   Using mobility aids without professional assessment or incorrect usage can sometimes lead to further injury or exacerbate existing conditions.<sup>11</sup> The consensus across various guidelines and user discussions strongly supports professional involvement.<sup>5</sup> This step should not be skipped, particularly for complex equipment.

### 6.5 Cleaning and Sanitisation

Once purchased, thorough cleaning is vital, especially for items with previous owners.

*   Follow manufacturer's instructions if available.
*   Use appropriate cleaning agents for different materials (metal, plastic, vinyl, fabric).
*   Pay special attention to disinfection using hospital-grade or appropriate disinfectants, particularly for items like commodes, shower chairs, mattresses, and cushions, to eliminate bacteria and viruses.

This multi-faceted approach – combining physical inspection, background checks, professional assessment, and proper cleaning – provides a robust framework for safely acquiring second-hand disability equipment.

## 7. NDIS Funding and Second-Hand Equipment: What You Need to Know

The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) can potentially fund the purchase of second-hand assistive technology (AT), but specific rules and considerations apply, particularly depending on how a participant's plan funding is managed.

### 7.1 Can You Use NDIS Funds for Used Equipment?

The ability to use NDIS funds for second-hand items largely depends on the plan management type:

*   **Self-Managed Participants:** Have the most flexibility. They can generally purchase second-hand equipment using their NDIS funds, provided the item meets the 'reasonable and necessary' criteria (see below), aligns with their plan goals, represents value for money, and they obtain adequate proof of purchase (like a detailed receipt).<sup>6</sup> Self-managers can buy from either NDIS-registered or unregistered providers/sellers, offering access to private sales and platforms like Gumtree or Facebook Marketplace.<sup>47</sup> This flexibility comes with the responsibility of managing funds, paying providers, and keeping records.<sup>47</sup>
*   **Plan-Managed Participants:** Also have significant flexibility. The participant chooses the item, and their Plan Manager makes the purchase on their behalf from either registered or unregistered providers/sellers, provided the NDIS criteria are met.<sup>48</sup> The Plan Manager handles payments, claims, and record-keeping, simplifying the process for the participant.<sup>48</sup> Plan Managers should support participants in making informed choices.<sup>48</sup>
*   **Agency-Managed Participants:** Face more restrictions. Funding managed by the NDIA generally must be used with NDIS-registered providers.<sup>50</sup> This often limits the ability to purchase directly from private sellers or non-registered platforms commonly used for second-hand sales. However, it might still be possible to acquire refurbished equipment offered by a registered provider.<sup>50</sup> Participants are advised to discuss options like refurbished items with their AT advisor or planner.<sup>50</sup>

Therefore, how a plan is managed directly impacts the range of sources available for second-hand equipment purchases using NDIS funds.

### 7.2 The 'Reasonable and Necessary' Test for Second-Hand AT

Even if purchased second-hand, any assistive technology funded by the NDIS must meet all the standard 'reasonable and necessary' criteria.<sup>18</sup> This means the item must:

*   Be related to the participant's disability.
*   Assist the participant in pursuing their goals.
*   Represent 'value for money'.
*   Be effective and beneficial for the participant.
*   Consider what is reasonable for families and the community to provide.
*   Be most appropriately funded by the NDIS (not other systems like health or education).<sup>49</sup>

For second-hand items, 'value for money' is nuanced. While a lower purchase price is advantageous, the NDIS also considers the item's expected lifespan, suitability, potential repair costs, and overall benefit.<sup>45</sup> A very cheap item that is unsuitable, unsafe, or breaks quickly does not represent good value.<sup>45</sup> The NDIS aims to fund the minimum specifications required to meet a need effectively.<sup>52</sup>

Participants may still need to provide evidence, such as an assessment report from an OT or other therapist, to justify the need for the equipment, even if it's second-hand, particularly for mid-cost (over $1,500) or high-cost (over $15,000) items.<sup>45</sup> For second-hand vehicles with existing modifications, specific OT assessments and engineering reports confirming safety, suitability, and compliance are required.<sup>45</sup>

### 7.3 Purchasing Process & Documentation

*   **Quotes/Estimates:** While formal quotes are typically required only for high-cost AT (over $15,000), the NDIS still requires evidence (like a cost estimate) for mid-cost AT ($1,500 - $15,000) to ensure value for money.<sup>51</sup> For second-hand items, this might involve documenting the asking price and comparing it to similar items or the estimated value of the remaining lifespan. Low-cost AT (under $1,500) generally doesn't require quotes.<sup>51</sup>
*   **Receipts/Proof of Purchase:** This is crucial, especially for self-managers who need to keep records for potential audits.<sup>6</sup> A valid receipt or proof of purchase should ideally include:
    *   Seller's name and contact details (or ABN if a business).
    *   Buyer's name.
    *   Date of purchase.
    *   Detailed description of the item purchased.
    *   Total cost paid.<sup>6</sup>

### 7.4 Selling Equipment Originally Bought with NDIS Funds

Understanding the rules around selling items previously funded by the NDIS is important:

*   **Ownership:** Assistive technology purchased outright using NDIS funds generally becomes the property of the participant.<sup>18</sup> Once ownership is established, the participant has the right to decide what to do with it, including selling it.<sup>53</sup>
*   **Right to Sell:** There are no explicit NDIS rules presented in the source materials that prohibit a participant from selling equipment they legally own.<sup>18</sup> Platforms like eBility are mentioned as places where individuals can sell their used AT.<sup>18</sup>
*   **Considerations:** While selling is generally permissible, participants should be mindful of potential (though unspecified in sources) implications for future NDIS funding requests if they need a replacement for the sold item soon after. Pricing should be fair, reflecting the item's used condition, aligning with the general principle of fair market value within the NDIS ecosystem.<sup>54</sup>

The key principle appears to be ownership: once the participant owns the equipment, they control its disposal.<sup>53</sup>

### 7.5 Fair Pricing & Consumer Rights

The broader NDIS environment emphasizes fairness and consumer protection:

*   **Fair Pricing:** The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission actively works to prevent providers from unreasonably overcharging NDIS participants (the "NDIS wedding tax").<sup>54</sup> While these rules target providers selling new goods/services, the underlying principle of fair market value is relevant context for the second-hand market as well.
*   **Australian Consumer Law (ACL):** Provides consumer guarantees when buying goods from businesses (including potentially some second-hand dealers or refurbishers). These guarantees include rights regarding acceptable quality, fitness for purpose, and matching descriptions.<sup>56</sup> Protections are weaker for private sales between individuals.<sup>5</sup> The ACCC website offers resources on consumer rights.<sup>56</sup>

Understanding these NDIS specifics allows participants and their support networks to make informed decisions about utilizing funding for second-hand equipment, ensuring compliance and maximising value.

## 8. Finding Local Options: "Near Me" and Australian Cities

A significant number of searches for second-hand disability equipment include location-specific terms like "near me" or names of major Australian cities (e.g., Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Gold Coast, Darwin – evident from the keyword list). Addressing this strong local intent is crucial for both users needing convenient access and for optimising content visibility.

### 8.1 The Importance of Local Search

Seeking local options offers distinct advantages:

*   **Inspection:** Buying locally allows potential buyers to physically inspect the equipment before purchase. This is vital for assessing condition, safety, and suitability – aspects difficult to gauge accurately online.<sup>4</sup>
*   **Cost Savings:** Eliminates potentially high shipping costs for bulky items like wheelchairs, scooters, or beds.
*   **Convenience:** Easier pickup or arrangement for viewing.
*   **Local Support:** Potentially easier access to local repair services or advice if buying from a local retailer or known community member.

### 8.2 Tips for Effective Local Searching

Combine online and offline strategies for the best results:

*   **Specific Online Searches:** Use precise search terms incorporating the location, e.g., "used wheelchair Sydney," "second hand mobility scooter Melbourne," "disability equipment for sale Brisbane near me."
*   **Localised Classifieds:** Filter general platforms like Gumtree and Facebook Marketplace by location. Check local community Facebook Buy/Sell groups, including those specifically for disability equipment within a city or region.
*   **Contact Local Retailers:** Identify mobility equipment stores in the area using online searches or store locators from national chains (e.g., ILS <sup>23</sup>, Daily Living Products <sup>24</sup>, Mobility HQ <sup>7</sup>, Statewide Home Health Care <sup>21</sup>). Crucially, call or email them specifically asking if they sell second-hand, refurbished, or clearance stock, or if they accept trade-ins. Many primarily sell new equipment, so direct inquiry is necessary to avoid wasted visits.<sup>20</sup>
*   **Local Charities & Organisations:** Contact local branches of charities known to handle equipment (e.g., Rotary clubs <sup>36</sup>, Salvos, Vinnies <sup>17</sup>) or local disability support services to inquire if they resell donated items or know of local sources.
