> "After my fall, I was worried I wouldn't be able to stay in my own home. Keeping up with everything felt impossible. My support worker, Jenny, doesn't just clean. She helps me with my shopping, makes sure I have meals prepared for the week, and even helped me set up online bill payments. It's not just help; it's peace of mind." - *Helen P., {suburb}*

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How is this different from a standard cleaning service?**
A standard cleaning service typically performs a deep clean. Domestic Assistance services are broader, ongoing support services focused on helping you manage your daily life. While they include light housekeeping to keep your home safe and tidy, they also cover vital tasks like shopping, cooking, and laundry to support your overall independence.

**Is this service covered by my Home Care Package or NDIS plan?**
Yes. For Home Care Packages, these services are a core component. For the NDIS, they typically fall under **Core Supports - Assistance with Daily Life**. Providers are experts at helping you align their services with your funding.

**Can I change the tasks my support worker does each visit?**
Absolutely. These services are designed to be flexible. You can work with your support worker to prioritise what you need done each visit, whether it's more help with meals one week or catching up on laundry the next.
