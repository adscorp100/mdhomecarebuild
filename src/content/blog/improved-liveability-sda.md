## **Understanding Improved Liveability SDA**

Improved Liveability Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) is a category of housing designed to enhance living conditions for NDIS participants with sensory, intellectual, or cognitive impairments. This design category focuses on creating accessible and safe environments that promote independence.

Key features include wide doorways, luminance contrasts, and noise reduction measures that meet Liveable Housing Australia Silver Level standards. Unlike higher support categories, Improved Liveability doesn't include specialized features for physical disabilities but concentrates on design elements that support individuals who don't require extensive physical support.

### **Is Improved Liveability SDA Being Phased Out?**

There's currently controversy surrounding this SDA category. The NDIS Review recommended removing Improved Liveability as a design category for new developments, suggesting that mainstream housing with home modifications would be sufficient.

However, as of March 2025, Improved Liveability remains a valid SDA category, and existing approved properties continue to receive funding. If you're currently in Improved Liveability accommodation, your funding will not change unless your circumstances do.

## **Key Features of Improved Liveability SDA**

Improved Liveability SDA includes design elements that enhance quality of life for people with sensory, intellectual, or cognitive impairments:

### **Design Requirements**

- **Doorways and corridors** - Wider than standard housing (minimum 950mm doorways)
- **Luminance contrasts** - High contrast between walls, floors, and fixtures
- **Improved wayfinding** - Clear signage and logical layout
- **Accessible bathroom** - At least one accessible bathroom meeting Silver level standards
- **Enhanced lighting** - Adjustable, non-flickering lighting throughout
- **Sound insulation** - Reduced noise transmission between rooms
- **Simple home technology** - Easy-to-use appliances and systems

These features create an environment that minimizes sensory overwhelm and maximizes independence.

## **Who is Improved Liveability SDA Suitable For?**

Improved Liveability SDA is specifically designed for NDIS participants who:

- Have sensory, intellectual, or cognitive impairments
- Can live relatively independently with appropriate design accommodations
- Do not require extensive physical accessibility features
- Need a calm, predictable environment with reduced sensory input
- Would benefit from features like clear wayfinding and high contrast

Common conditions that may qualify for Improved Liveability SDA include autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, acquired brain injury, and some mental health conditions.

## **Funding and Access**

NDIS funding generally covers the capital costs of Improved Liveability SDA, with participants contributing a "reasonable rent contribution" (typically 25% of the Disability Support Pension plus Commonwealth Rent Assistance).

To access Improved Liveability SDA funding, participants must:

1. Demonstrate that SDA is a "reasonable and necessary" support in their NDIS plan
2. Show that Improved Liveability is the appropriate design category for their needs
3. Provide evidence from occupational therapists or other specialists
4. Work with their Support Coordinator to find suitable accommodation

## **Comparison with Other SDA Design Categories**

| Design Category | Purpose | Key Features |
|----------------|---------|--------------|
| Improved Liveability | Sensory/cognitive accessibility | Enhanced wayfinding, contrast, noise reduction |
| Fully Accessible | Physical accessibility | Wider doorways, hoists, accessible bathrooms |
| Robust | Durability for behavioral needs | Reinforced walls, impact-resistant materials |
| High Physical Support | Complex physical needs | Ceiling hoists, automated doors, 24/7 support |

## **Finding Improved Liveability SDA**

Despite potential policy changes, many Improved Liveability SDA properties remain available. To find suitable options:

1. Work with your Support Coordinator
2. Search the [SDA Housing Finder](https://www.housinghub.org.au/)
3. Connect with SDA providers in your area
4. Consider joining the SDA Housing Seekers Facebook group

## **Final Thoughts**

While the future of Improved Liveability SDA is uncertain for new builds, it remains an important housing option for many NDIS participants with sensory, intellectual, or cognitive impairments. If you believe this SDA category may suit your needs, discuss it with your NDIS planners and support team as soon as possible to explore your options.
