## Unlock Your Support: What Can You *Really* Spend Your Home Care Package Funds On in 2025?Navigating the world of aged care funding can feel overwhelming, especially when you're trying to understand exactly **what you can spend your Aged Care Package on**. Whether you call it a Home Care Package (HCP), Aged Care Package, or simply '**my home care**' funding, the goal is the same: to provide you with the support you need to live safely and independently in your own home for as long as possible.

You've been approved for a package – perhaps a **Level 1 HCP**, **Level 2 HCP**, **Level 3 HCP**, or you have **HCP Level 4 funding** for higher needs – but now the big question is: **what can home care package funds be used for**?

This guide breaks down the **HCP guidelines** to clarify **what can be included in a home care package**, what's generally excluded, and how to ensure your spending aligns with your assessed care needs.

## The Guiding Principle: Your Assessed Care NeedsBefore diving into specifics, the most crucial rule is this: **Home Care Package funds must be used for services and items directly related to your assessed care needs, as documented in your care plan.**

The funding isn't just cash to spend freely; it's specifically targeted support identified through your ACAT (or ACAS in Victoria) assessment and further detailed in collaboration with your chosen home care provider. The aim is always to enhance your health, safety, and independence at home.

### Addressing Specific Questions:**Can a home care package pay for medication?** Generally, no. The package doesn't typically cover the *cost* of the medications themselves, especially those covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). However, funds *can* be used for services related to medication, such as:

- A nurse managing your medication administration.
- A support worker reminding you to take medication.
- Transport to the pharmacy to collect prescriptions.
- Pharmacy packing services (like Webster-paks) may sometimes be covered if directly linked to a care need identified in your plan – discuss this with your provider.

**What about Home Care Package Cleaning?** Yes, domestic assistance like cleaning, laundry, and tidying is a very common and acceptable use of HCP funds if it helps you maintain a safe and healthy home environment and is included in your care plan.

## What Can Home Care Package Funds *NOT* Be Used For? Common ExclusionsUnderstanding exclusions is just as important:

- **Everyday Living Costs:** Rent, mortgage payments, general utility bills (electricity, gas, water, phone, internet), groceries (the food itself, distinct from meal prep services).
- **Items Covered Elsewhere:** Services or items covered by Medicare (like GP visits, specialist appointments) or the PBS (most prescription medications).
- **Travel & Accommodation:** Holidays, travel expenses not related to accessing care, accommodation costs.
- **Entertainment:** Items like streaming service subscriptions or club memberships (unless part of a specific, goal-oriented social support activity in your care plan).
- **Cash Withdrawals:** Funds cannot be withdrawn as cash.
- **Services for Others:** The package is for the assessed individual only.
- **Major Home Modifications:** Significant structural changes usually fall outside the scope of an HCP and may require other funding sources like home modification grants.

## Understanding HCP Levels and FundingWhile this post focuses on *what* you can spend funds on, remember that the *amount* available depends on your assigned **HCP level**. The **HCP levels** represent different amounts of funding:

- **HCP Level 1:** Basic care needs.
- **HCP Level 2:** Low-level care needs (**Level 2 HCP funding** supports more services than Level 1. Also referred to as 'Level 2 package').
- **HCP Level 3:** Intermediate care needs.
- **HCP Level 4:** High-level care needs (**HCP Level 4 funding** provides the most substantial support).

Regardless of the level, the rules about *what* the funds can be used for remain the same – it must align with your assessed needs and care plan.

## Making the Most of Your Home Care Package- **Review Your Care Plan Regularly:** Your needs change, and your care plan should reflect that. Discuss adjustments with your provider.
- **Communicate with Your Provider:** They are your key resource. Ask questions like "**what can I buy with my home care package**?" or "**what can be included in a home care package budget**?" They can clarify based on **HCP guidelines** and your specific situation. Consider asking about 'my home care services' availability.
- **Understand Your Budget:** Ask for clear, itemised statements showing how your funds are being spent.
- **Embrace Consumer Directed Care (CDC):** This principle gives you control over how your funds are used (within the rules). Work *with* your provider to make choices that best suit you.

## The Bottom LineYour Home Care Package is a valuable resource designed to support your independence and wellbeing at home. Knowing **what you can spend your aged care package on** empowers you to make informed choices.
