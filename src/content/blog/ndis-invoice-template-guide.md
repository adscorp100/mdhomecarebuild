## GST Requirements for NDIS Invoices

Understanding GST treatment is crucial for NDIS invoicing. Here's what you need to know:

### GST-Free Services (Most NDIS Supports)

| Service Type | GST Status | Invoice Note |
|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Personal care and daily living | GST-Free | Include: "GST-free under NDIS" |
| Community participation | GST-Free | Show GST = $0 |
| Support coordination | GST-Free | Display ABN regardless |
| Therapy services | GST-Free | No GST component |
| Plan management | GST-Free | State GST exemption |

### GST-Applicable Services (Exceptions)

| Service Type | GST Status | Invoice Requirement |
|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| Transport (taxi, rideshare) | 10% GST | Show GST component separately |
| Some equipment purchases | 10% GST | Display "Total incl. GST" |
| Certain commercial services | 10% GST | Must be GST-registered |

### Key GST Rules:

1. **Display ABN on all invoices** - even for GST-free services
2. **Only charge GST if registered** - registration required if turnover exceeds $150,000/year
3. **Label correctly** - Use "Tax Invoice" only if charging GST; otherwise use "Invoice"
4. **Separate GST line** - Always show GST amount, even if $0.00

> **Important:** If you're unsure whether a specific service is GST-free, check the [NDIS Pricing Arrangements 2025-26](https://www.ndis.gov.au/providers/pricing-arrangements) or consult a tax professional.

## Common NDIS Invoicing Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

Based on feedback from plan managers and the NDIA, these are the most common reasons invoices get rejected:

### Mistake #1: Wrong Support Item Code

**The Problem:** Using outdated codes or incorrect code variations (e.g., using `01_001` instead of `01_001_0107_1_1`)

**The Fix:**
- Always use the **2025-26 NDIS Support Catalogue** - updated November 2025
- Verify each code matches the exact service delivered
- Check that time-of-day variations are correct (weekday, evening, weekend, public holiday)

**Quick Reference - Common Support Codes 2025-26:**

| Service | Weekday Daytime | Saturday | Sunday | Public Holiday |
|---------|-----------------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Self-Care (Standard) | 01_011_0107_1_1 | 01_013_0107_1_1 | 01_014_0107_1_1 | 01_012_0107_1_1 |
| Community Access (Standard) | 04_104_0125_6_1 | 04_105_0125_6_1 | 04_106_0125_6_1 | 04_107_0125_6_1 |
| Self-Care (High Intensity) | 01_400_0104_1_1 | 01_401_0104_1_1 | 01_402_0104_1_1 | 01_403_0104_1_1 |

For a complete list of codes, see our **[NDIS Line Items Guide 2025-26](/blog/ndis-line-items-guide-2024-25/)**.

### Mistake #2: Price Exceeds PAPL Limit

**The Problem:** Charging more than the maximum price limit set by the NDIA

**The Fix:**
- Download the latest **NDIS Support Catalogue 2025-26** (updated November 24, 2025)
- Apply correct location loadings (Remote: +40%, Very Remote: +50%)
- Remember prices include all costs - no additional fees allowed

**2025-26 Price Limits (National - MMM1-5):**

| Support Type | Weekday Day | Weekday Eve | Weekday Night | Saturday | Sunday | Public Holiday |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Standard Intensity | $70.23/hr | $77.38/hr | $78.82/hr | $98.82/hr | $127.44/hr | $156.03/hr |
| High Intensity | $75.97/hr | $83.73/hr | $85.31/hr | $107.01/hr | $137.98/hr | $168.81/hr |

### Mistake #3: Bundling Travel with Service Time

**The Problem:** Including travel time within service hours instead of separating

**The Fix:**
- Create **separate line items** for service delivery and travel
- Use appropriate travel codes or show as $0.00 if not charging
- Document travel distance/time in your records

**Example:**
```
Service: Assistance with Self-Care - 2 hours @ $70.23 = $140.46
Travel: Provider travel - 30 mins @ $0.00 = $0.00
```

### Mistake #4: Missing or Incorrect ABN

**The Problem:** ABN not shown or doesn't match registered details

**The Fix:**
- Always include your 11-digit ABN
- Verify ABN is correct at [ABN Lookup](https://abr.business.gov.au/)
- Ensure business name matches ABN registration

### Mistake #5: Duplicate Invoice Numbers

**The Problem:** Reusing invoice numbers after corrections or across participants

**The Fix:**
- Use a **sequential numbering system** with no gaps
- If voiding an invoice, mark as "CANCELLED" and issue a new number
- Consider format: `INV-YYYY-NNNNN` (e.g., INV-2026-00123)

### Mistake #6: Late Submission (Beyond 2-Year Window)

**The Problem:** Submitting claims more than 2 years after service delivery

**The Fix:**
- Set calendar reminders for claim deadlines
- Submit invoices **weekly** for optimal cash flow
- Track outstanding claims in a spreadsheet

> **New Rule (October 2025):** The NDIA now rejects all claims submitted more than 2 years from the service start date. This replaced the previous 1-year window.

### Mistake #7: Therapy Under Wrong Budget

**The Problem:** Claiming therapy services under Core budget instead of Capacity Building

**The Fix:**
- All therapy services must now be claimed under **Capacity Building - Improved Daily Living**
- Check the participant's plan has Capacity Building funding
- Use correct therapy line item codes (15_XXX series)

## How to Submit NDIS Invoices

The submission process depends on how the participant's plan is managed:

### Plan-Managed Participants

1. **Send invoice directly** to the plan manager via email or their portal
2. **Include all mandatory fields** as outlined above
3. **Attach supporting documents** if required (timesheets, quotes)
4. **Expected payment:** 7-14 business days after approval

### NDIA-Managed Participants

1. **Log into** the [myplace Provider Portal](https://proda.humanservices.gov.au/)
2. **Create a Payment Request** (not a traditional invoice)
3. **Enter service details** with correct support item codes
4. **Submit within 90 days** of service delivery
5. **Expected payment:** 2-3 business days after approval

### Self-Managed Participants

1. **Invoice the participant directly** via email
2. **Participant claims reimbursement** from their NDIS funds
3. **Keep copies** of all invoices for audit purposes
4. **Follow up** if payment is delayed

---

## Record Keeping Requirements

The NDIA requires providers to maintain comprehensive records for audit purposes:

### What to Keep

| Document | Retention Period | Storage Format |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Invoices | 7 years | Electronic (PDF) |
| Timesheets | 7 years | Electronic |
| Service agreements | Duration + 7 years | Electronic |
| Receipts (equipment) | 7 years | Electronic |
| Communication records | 7 years | Electronic |

### Best Practices

- **Organise by participant:** Create folders structured as `Participant Name/Year/Month`
- **Back up regularly:** Use cloud storage (OneDrive, Google Drive, SharePoint)
- **Name files consistently:** e.g., `INV-2026-00123-JaneSmith-Dec2026.pdf`
- **Keep audit trails:** Document any changes or corrections

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I create an NDIS invoice?
Use an invoice template that includes all 13 mandatory fields: provider details (ABN, business name, contact), participant details (name, NDIS number), invoice number, date, service dates, support item codes, descriptions, quantities, unit prices, line totals, GST status, and total payable.

### What information must be on an NDIS invoice?
Mandatory fields include: provider ABN and business name, participant name and NDIS number, unique invoice number, date of issue, service dates and times, NDIS support item codes from the 2025-26 Support Catalogue, service descriptions, quantities, unit prices (not exceeding PAPL limits), line totals, GST status, and total payable.

### Is there a free NDIS invoice template?
Yes, the NDIA provides free invoice templates on the Provider Portal. You can also download free templates from Imploy, or use our template above. Free accounting software like Zoho Invoice (5 clients) and Zeller Invoices (unlimited) also offer NDIS-compliant templates.

### Do NDIS invoices need GST?
Most NDIS supports are GST-free, so you show GST as $0.00 and include a statement like "This invoice is GST-free under NDIS Pricing Arrangements." However, you must still display your ABN. Some services like transport may be GST-applicable.

### How long do I have to submit an NDIS invoice?
As of October 3, 2026, you have **2 years** from the service delivery date to submit claims. For NDIA-managed participants, payment requests should be lodged within 90 days of the service booking end date.

### What is the most common reason NDIS invoices are rejected?
Incorrect or outdated support item codes are the #1 cause of rejections. Always use codes from the current 2025-26 NDIS Support Catalogue and ensure time-of-day variations (weekday, weekend, public holiday) are correct.

### Can I charge more than the NDIS price limit?
No, the PAPL price limits are maximums that cannot be exceeded. Charging above these limits will result in invoice rejection. You can charge less than the price limit if you choose.

### How often should I submit NDIS invoices?
For optimal cash flow, submit invoices weekly. This reduces admin burden while ensuring regular payments. Some providers submit daily for high-volume services, while others batch monthly - but monthly batching increases the risk of errors and cash flow issues.

### Do I need special software for NDIS invoicing?
No, but it helps. You can use free templates in Excel or Word, but dedicated NDIS software like ShiftCare, CareMaster, or GoodHuman can auto-validate codes, check price limits, and reduce errors significantly.

### What happens if my invoice is rejected?
Review the rejection reason provided, correct the issue (wrong code, exceeded price limit, missing field), and resubmit with a **new invoice number**. Never reuse the rejected invoice number.
