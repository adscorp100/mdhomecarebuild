## Patterns & Insights
- AI referral traffic growing steadily, ChatGPT dominant (82% of AI referrals)
- Template/tool pages and insurance guides are the AI referral winners
- Jobs page now appearing in AI referrals (new pattern worth watching)
- Site is healthy, Tuesday traffic up vs last Tuesday
- 229 content files touched in last 7 days (massive churn from repositioning). Need to let this settle before drawing conclusions.
