Understanding NDIS support worker pay rates can be confusing. There's a difference between what the NDIS pays providers (the Price Guide), what providers must pay workers (the SCHADS Award), and what workers actually take home. Whether you're a support worker, NDIS carer (another common term for support workers), or participant, this guide covers everything you need to know.

> **Latest Update (November 2025):** This guide reflects the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2025-26 v1.1, effective 24 November 2025.

This guide breaks down all the rates for 2025-26, including the November 2025 price updates, public holiday penalty rates, night shift loadings, and real-world earnings for different scenarios.

## NDIS Support Worker Pay Rates 2025-26 (Quick Summary)

| Shift Type | NDIS Price Limit | Worker Receives (SCHADS) |
|------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Weekday Daytime | $70.23/hr | $30-$45/hr |
| Saturday | $98.66/hr | $45-$68/hr |
| Sunday | $127.08/hr | $60-$90/hr |
| Public Holiday | $155.51/hr | $75-$112/hr |

## How Much Do NDIS Support Workers Get Paid Per Hour?

The amount an NDIS support worker (or NDIS carer) gets paid depends on their classification level under the SCHADS Award and the type of shift they work. Entry-level workers start around $30/hr, while experienced workers can earn $45+/hr before penalty rates. Weekend and public holiday shifts significantly boost earnings.

## What Is the NDIS Hourly Rate for Support Workers in 2025?

The current NDIS price limit for standard support work is **$70.23 per hour** on weekdays (as of November 2025). This is the maximum providers can charge participants—not what workers receive. Workers typically earn between $30-$45/hr depending on their level, with the rest covering provider overheads.

## NDIS Pay Rate Changes November 2025

The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2025-26 v1.1, effective 24 November 2025, includes updated price limits for disability support worker services.

**Key points:**
- Standard support weekday rate increased to $70.23/hr (up from $67.56/hr)
- High intensity weekday rate increased to $73.08/hr
- All weekend and public holiday rates adjusted accordingly
- The increase applies to all support types and shift times

## Understanding the Two Rate Systems

### NDIS Price Guide vs SCHADS Award

| Aspect | NDIS Price Guide | SCHADS Award |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| **What it is** | Maximum price providers can charge | Minimum wage providers must pay |
| **Who sets it** | NDIA (National Disability Insurance Agency) | Fair Work Commission |
| **Purpose** | Caps participant costs | Protects worker pay |
| **Typical weekday rate** | $70.23/hr (standard support) | $30-$40/hr (depending on level) |

The gap between these rates covers provider overheads: superannuation, insurance, workers compensation, leave entitlements, training, administration, and profit margin.

### Why Work Sundays as an NDIS Support Worker?

**Double time pay makes Sundays incredibly lucrative.** A support worker doing a single 8-hour Sunday shift earns what would take 16 hours to earn on weekdays.

**Example earnings for an 8-hour Sunday shift:**
- Level 1: $60.04 x 8 = **$480.32**
- Level 2: $69.16 x 8 = **$553.28**
- Level 3: $77.30 x 8 = **$618.40**

Compare this to weekday earnings for the same 8 hours:
- Level 1: $30.02 x 8 = $240.16
- Level 2: $34.58 x 8 = $276.64
- Level 3: $38.65 x 8 = $309.20

### Sunday Night Shift Rates

If you work a Sunday night shift (10pm onwards), you receive both the Sunday loading (2x) and the night shift loading (+15%):

| Level | Base Rate | Sunday Night Rate | 8-Hour Earnings |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Level 1 | $30.02 | $69.05/hr | $552.40 |
| Level 2 | $34.58 | $79.53/hr | $636.24 |
| Level 3 | $38.65 | $88.90/hr | $711.20 |

## NDIS Saturday Support Worker Rates 2025

Saturday rates provide **150% of the base hourly rate** (time and a half) under the SCHADS Award.

### Quick Reference: Saturday Rates by Level

| Support Level | Base Rate | Saturday Rate (1.5x) | NDIS Price Limit |
|--------------|-----------|----------------------|------------------|
| Level 1 (Entry) | $30.02 | $45.03/hr | $98.66/hr |

| Level 4 (Senior) | $45.10 | $67.65/hr | $98.66/hr |
| High Intensity | $34.58 | $51.87/hr | $102.66/hr |

### Saturday vs Sunday: Which Pays More?

| Comparison | Saturday (1.5x) | Sunday (2x) | Difference |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| Level 2 hourly | $51.87 | $69.16 | +$17.29/hr |
| 8-hour shift | $414.96 | $553.28 | +$138.32 |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between the NDIS Price Guide and what support workers get paid?

The NDIS Price Guide sets the **maximum price providers can charge participants**. The SCHADS Award sets the **minimum wage providers must pay workers**. The difference covers employer costs like superannuation, insurance, workers compensation, and overheads.

### How much do NDIS support workers get paid per hour in 2025?

Under the SCHADS Award, support workers earn **$30-$57 per hour** depending on their classification level. Casual workers receive an additional 25% loading. Weekend and night shifts attract penalty rates that can more than double the base rate.

### What is the NDIS Sunday rate?

The NDIS Sunday rate (price limit) for standard support is **$127.08 per hour** as of November 2025. For high intensity support, it's $132.25/hr.

### What is the NDIS Saturday rate?

The NDIS Saturday rate (price limit) for standard support is **$98.66 per hour** as of November 2025. For high intensity support, it's $102.66/hr. Support workers receive time-and-a-half under the SCHADS Award—a Level 2 worker earns $51.87/hr on Saturdays (1.5x their $34.58 base rate).

### Do NDIS price increases go directly to support workers?

Not automatically. NDIS price limit increases apply to what participants pay. Provider organisations decide whether to pass this on as wage increases. However, the SCHADS Award sets minimum wages that all providers must pay, and these are updated annually.

### What is Level 1, 2, 3 support worker?

Support worker levels reflect experience and qualifications:
- **Level 1:** Entry-level, basic personal care, works under supervision
- **Level 2:** Certificate III qualified, standard support duties

### How does travel pay work for NDIS support workers?

Providers can claim travel time between participants (capped at 30 mins metro, 60 mins regional). Workers should be paid for this travel time. Kilometre allowance is $0.99/km when using a personal vehicle.

### Are NDIS rates the same in all states?

Yes, NDIS price limits are national—the same rates apply in QLD, VIC, NSW, SA, WA, TAS, NT, and ACT. The SCHADS Award is also federal, so minimum wages are consistent across states.

### What is TTP in NDIS pricing?

TTP (Temporary Transformation Payment) was a conditional loading providers could claim during NDIS transition. It's being phased out and replaced with the standard price limits.
