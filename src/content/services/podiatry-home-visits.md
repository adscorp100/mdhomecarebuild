## Frequently Asked Questions

**What happens during a home podiatry visit?**
Your podiatrist will have a friendly chat about your concerns. They will then conduct a thorough assessment of your feet, circulation, and nerve function. They'll provide treatment on the spot (e.g., cutting nails, treating a corn) and create a clear plan for your ongoing foot health.

**Is at-home podiatry safe and hygienic?**
Absolutely. We adhere to the strictest infection control standards. All our instruments are single-use or fully sterilized in an autoclave to hospital-grade standards.

**How often should I see a podiatrist?**
For general care, most people benefit from a visit every 6-8 weeks. If you have a specific condition like diabetes or an ingrown toenail, your podiatrist will recommend a schedule tailored to your needs.
