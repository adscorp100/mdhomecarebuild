### Personal Stories: Support Worker Experiences
Real experiences from current support workers provide valuable insights:

#### Emma's Experience: From Casual Worker to Team Leader
*"I started as a casual support worker while studying occupational therapy. I loved the practical experience so much that I changed my career path. Five years later, I'm a team leader specializing in supporting young adults with autism to develop independent living skills. The flexibility allowed me to balance work with raising my young child, and the professional development opportunities have been exceptional. The most rewarding aspect has been seeing participants achieve goals they initially thought impossible."*

#### Jamal's Perspective: Career Change at 45
*"After 20 years in retail management, I was burnt out and searching for more meaningful work. I started as a weekend support worker with no formal qualifications, just transferable skills from managing teams and customer service. Three years later, I've completed my Certificate IV and specialize in supporting men with psychosocial disability. The work is more fulfilling than anything I've done before, though the documentation aspects can be time-consuming. The flexible scheduling allows me to pursue my passion for photography alongside support work."*
