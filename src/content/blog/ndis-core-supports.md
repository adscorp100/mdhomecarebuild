## Introduction: What are NDIS Core Supports and Why Understanding Them Matters?

The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) represents a fundamental shift in how Australia supports people with permanent and significant disability. It provides funding for 'reasonable and necessary' supports, aiming to help participants pursue their goals, increase independence, enhance social and economic participation, and improve overall quality of life. Central to achieving these aims is the **Core Supports budget**, a critical component of many NDIS plans.

NDIS Core Supports funding is specifically designed to assist participants with the essential activities of daily living, address their current disability-related needs, and help them work towards their personal goals. This budget directly supports the everyday aspects of life, making it a cornerstone of the NDIS participant experience. A thorough understanding of what Core Supports encompass, how the funding can be used, and the rules governing its flexibility is not merely an administrative task; it is fundamental to effectively utilising an NDIS plan. Gaining clarity empowers participants and their support networks to exercise greater choice and control, make informed decisions, and ultimately maximise the benefits of the scheme to live a more independent and fulfilling life.

Core Supports represent one of the three main budget categories within an NDIS plan, sitting alongside Capacity Building Supports and Capital Supports. Each budget serves a distinct purpose and operates under different rules, particularly regarding flexibility. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date, and practical explanation of NDIS Core Supports, delving deeper than other resources by incorporating recent legislative changes and offering extensive examples to demystify this vital funding stream.

The ability to navigate the Core Supports budget effectively is intrinsically linked to achieving greater independence and community participation – core tenets of the NDIS. Because these funds directly enable activities essential for daily living and engagement, grasping the scope and application of this budget empowers participants to actively shape their support arrangements and pursue their life goals. Therefore, this guide frames Core Supports not just as a funding allocation, but as a key enabler for participants to leverage the NDIS towards greater autonomy and inclusion.

## Decoding Your NDIS Plan: Core vs. Capacity Building vs. Capital Supports

An NDIS plan typically allocates funding across three distinct support budgets (also referred to as support purposes): Core Supports, Capacity Building Supports, and Capital Supports. Understanding the fundamental differences between these budgets is crucial for effective plan management and ensuring supports align with intended outcomes. The NDIS intentionally separates funding based on these purposes, reflecting a structured, insurance-based approach focused on meeting immediate needs, fostering long-term independence, and funding necessary investments, all while ensuring scheme sustainability.

- **Core Supports:** This budget is primarily focused on supporting a participant's *current*, ongoing disability-related needs and assisting with everyday activities. It helps participants manage daily life and participate in their community. A key feature of the Core Supports budget is its general **flexibility**, allowing participants (within certain rules) to allocate funds across different Core categories to best meet their needs at any given time.
- **Capacity Building Supports:** In contrast to Core, this budget focuses on the *future*. Its purpose is to fund supports that help participants build their skills, independence, and ability to achieve their goals, potentially reducing their reliance on supports over the long term. This budget is **not flexible between categories**; funding allocated to one Capacity Building category (e.g., 'Improved Daily Living' for therapy) cannot be used for another (e.g., 'Improved Life Choices' for plan management). Key categories include Support Coordination, Improved Daily Living (therapies, assessments), Finding and Keeping a Job, Improved Health & Wellbeing, and Improved Life Choices (often for plan management).
- **Capital Supports:** This budget is for significant *investments* and higher-cost items. It covers things like assistive technology (AT) costing over a certain threshold (e.g., wheelchairs, communication devices), equipment, modifications to homes or vehicles, and funding for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Capital Supports funding is generally **highly restricted**; it is typically allocated based on specific quotes and can only be used for the particular item or purpose it was approved for.

This intentional separation of funding reflects the NDIS's commitment to providing tailored support. Core funding addresses immediate, everyday needs, Capacity Building invests in future potential, and Capital funding facilitates necessary major purchases or modifications. Participants must understand these distinctions not only for budget management but also to ensure their chosen supports align with the intended purpose of each funding type, preventing potential funding gaps or the inability to access desired supports.

The following table provides a concise overview of the key differences:

| Budget Type | Primary Purpose | Flexibility Level | Example Support Categories/Items |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Core Supports** | Help with everyday activities, current disability needs, achieving goals | Generally Flexible (within Core categories, subject to rules like stated supports & transport) | Assistance with Daily Life (personal care, household tasks), Consumables (continence aids, low-cost AT), Assistance with Social & Community Participation, Transport |
| **Capacity Building** | Build skills and independence for the future, reduce long-term support needs | Restricted (Cannot move funds between categories) | Support Coordination, Improved Daily Living (therapy), Improved Life Choices (plan management), Finding & Keeping a Job, Improved Relationships, Improved Health & Wellbeing |
| **Capital Supports** | Investments in high-cost AT, equipment, modifications, SDA | Restricted (Generally tied to specific quoted items/purposes) | Assistive Technology (wheelchairs, vehicle mods), Home Modifications (bathroom rails, ramps), Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) funding |

**Plan your NDIS budget:** Use our free **[NDIS Budget Planner](/tools/ndis-budget-planner)** to allocate your Core, Capacity Building, and Capital funding and calculate your weekly support hours. You can also use the **[NDIS Therapy Hours Calculator](/tools/ndis-therapy-calculator)** to estimate how many therapy sessions fit within your Capacity Building budget.

## Deep Dive: The Four NDIS Core Support Categories

The Core Supports budget is typically structured around four key categories, designed to cover the broad spectrum of everyday needs. While the funding within this budget often allows for flexibility *between* these categories (subject to specific rules and exceptions discussed later), understanding the purpose and scope of each category is essential for planning how to best utilise the available funds. The definitions provide a framework, but it is the specific examples that truly illuminate the practical application of this funding, helping participants identify the supports that can make a real difference in their lives. Providing numerous, diverse examples is therefore crucial for clarity and empowering participants to see the possibilities within their plan.

### 4.1 Assistance with Daily Life (ADL): Examples and Uses

- **Definition:** This category funds supports that assist or supervise participants with personal tasks during their day-to-day life, enabling them to live as independently as possible. These supports are typically provided individually and can be delivered in various environments, including the participant's own home.
- **Examples:** Assistance with Daily Life funding can cover a wide range of activities, including:
  - **Personal Care:** Help with activities such as showering, bathing, oral hygiene, dressing, and grooming.
  - **Household Tasks:** Assistance with essential domestic chores like house cleaning, laundry, shopping, preparing or delivering meals, and light gardening or yard maintenance. It is important to note that while support for *doing* these tasks is funded, the NDIS generally does not cover standard day-to-day living costs like groceries or utility bills, nor standard household items like furniture or appliances (e.g., washing machines), although exceptions may apply under the 'replacement support' rule for specific disability-related needs.
  - **Support Worker Assistance:** Funding for a support worker to provide hands-on help or supervision with various daily tasks as needed.
  - **Shared Living Support (Supported Independent Living - SIL):** Assistance with daily tasks provided within a shared living environment. This often includes help with personal care, meal preparation, and skill development within the home. Note that SIL funding itself is often structured and quoted separately and may be a 'stated support', meaning it's less flexible.
  - **Accommodation-Related Support:** Funding related to short-term accommodation (STA), often used for respite or when usual carers are unavailable (covering care costs, not just rent). Medium Term Accommodation (MTA) may also be funded under specific circumstances while awaiting long-term housing solutions. Supports related to Individualised Living Options (ILO) can also fall under this category.
  - **Disability-Related Health Supports:** Assistance from a suitably qualified worker (like a nurse or trained support worker) for managing regular health needs related to the participant's disability. Examples include assistance with catheter care, stoma management, wound care, managing diabetes plans, or implementing mealtime management plans under the guidance of a clinician. This can include specialised home-based assistance, particularly relevant for children with complex needs.

### 4.2 Consumables: Everyday Items Explained with Examples

- **Definition:** This category provides funding for participants to purchase everyday items they need specifically because of their disability-related needs.
- **Examples:** The Consumables budget can be used for a variety of necessary items:
  - **Continence Products:** Funding for items such as pads, pull-ups, nappies, catheters (indwelling, intermittent), drainage bags, leg bags, bottles, and straps.
  - **Low-Cost Assistive Technology (AT):** Generally refers to disability-specific items under a certain price threshold (participants should check the current NDIS guidelines, often around $1,500). Examples include modified eating utensils, non-slip bathmats, dressing aids, basic communication cards or apps, adaptive grips for pens, walking sticks, pressure-care cushions, and potentially simple electronic devices like tablets if primarily used for disability-related needs such as communication apps or accessing telehealth appointments.
  - **Home Enteral Nutrition (HEN) Products:** Covers HEN formula or nutritional supplements if the cost exceeds what is available through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). It also includes related equipment and consumables like feeding tubes and pumps, but generally excludes the cost of standard food.
  - **Disability-Related Health Consumables:** Items required for managing health needs arising from a disability, such as wound care supplies (dressings, gauze, bandages, tape), respiratory support consumables (masks, tubing for CPAP/BiPAP machines - though the machines themselves are usually Capital), stoma care supplies (bags, seals), and catheter care supplies.
  - **Low-Cost AT Rental/Hire:** Funding to rent or hire low-cost assistive technology items.
  - **Training for Consumables/AT:** Funding for training on how to use specific low-cost AT or disability-related health consumables effectively.

### 4.3 Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation: Examples and Ideas

- **Definition:** This category funds supports that enable participants to engage in community, social, recreational, or economic activities. The aim is to facilitate participation and inclusion alongside peers. Supports can be provided individually or in groups, within the community or at a centre.
- **Examples:** Funding can be used in various ways to support participation:
  - **Support Worker Assistance:** Paying for a support worker to accompany and assist the participant to attend community events (e.g., festivals, local library activities, sporting events), social outings (e.g., meeting friends, going to the movies), recreational activities (e.g., joining a club, attending a hobby class), vocational activities (e.g., volunteering, work experience), or group activities.
  - **Activity-Specific Support:** Funding for a support worker to provide practical assistance *during* an activity, such as help changing into sports gear, setting up equipment for a craft class, or providing prompts and support to engage in the activity itself.
  - **Group Activities:** Covering the disability-specific support costs associated with participating in group-based activities run in the community or at a centre. Note that standard activity fees (e.g., entry fees, membership costs, class tuition) that anyone would pay are generally *not* covered by the NDIS.
  - **Workplace or Economic Participation Support:** Funding for a support worker to assist a participant in their workplace or during work-related activities. (Note: While Core supports the *presence* of a support worker, skill development for finding/keeping a job typically falls under Capacity Building).
  - **Cultural Participation:** Support to participate in culturally significant activities, which is particularly relevant following recent clarifications for First Nations participants.

### 4.4 Transport: Understanding NDIS Transport Funding

- **Definition:** This category provides funding to help participants travel to access NDIS-funded supports, or to attend community activities, work, study, or appointments, specifically when they are unable to use public transport without substantial difficulty due to their disability. It can cover the participant's own transport costs (like taxis or rideshares) or the cost of a provider transporting the participant.
- **How it's Funded:** Transport funding can be allocated in different ways:
  - **Periodic Payments:** Often provided as a regular payment (e.g., fortnightly or monthly) directly into the participant's or nominee's bank account. In newer NDIS plans (using the PACE system), this may appear under a separate 'Recurring Supports' budget.
  - **Provider Transport:** Funding allocated within the Core budget for providers to charge for transporting the participant to and from NDIS-funded activities (often referred to as 'activity-based transport'). Specific rules and rates apply, outlined in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements.
  - **Specialised Transport:** Funding towards specialised transport services, modified vehicles, or to cover the gap between standard transport costs and disability-specific needs (e.g., supplementing state/territory taxi subsidy schemes).

- **Levels of Funding:** For periodic payments, the NDIS often uses three indicative funding levels based on the participant's level of work, study, or community participation, with potential for higher funding in exceptional circumstances related to employment needs. These levels are subject to annual indexation.
- **Important Considerations:**
  - Transport funding is intended for the participant's disability-related transport needs; it generally does not cover transport for family members or carers undertaking everyday tasks.
  - It does not cover standard public transport fares or tolls.
  - Eligibility hinges on the participant being unable to use public transport without substantial difficulty due to their disability.
  - Transport funding, particularly periodic payments, is often considered less flexible than other Core categories and may be 'stated', meaning it cannot be easily swapped for other supports.

## Flexibility in Your Core Budget: Rules, Limits & Recent Changes (Post-Oct 2024)

One of the most frequently highlighted features of the NDIS Core Supports budget is its flexibility. However, this flexibility is not absolute and operates within a specific set of rules and limitations, which have evolved over time, including significant clarifications introduced in October 2024. Understanding these nuances is critical for effectively managing Core funding.

### 5.1 The General Rule: Core Support Flexibility

The NDIS consistently describes the Core Supports budget as the *most flexible* of the three main budget types. The underlying principle is that participants should have the ability to use their Core funding in a way that best meets their day-to-day needs as they change. In most situations, this means funds allocated under one Core category (e.g., Assistance with Daily Life) can be used to purchase supports from another Core category (e.g., Consumables or Assistance with Social and Community Participation), provided the purchase meets all other NDIS criteria.

A practical example involves Charlotte, whose goals include increasing independence and making friends. She initially has Core funding primarily for help with dressing and cooking (Assistance with Daily Life). Because her Core budget is flexible, she chooses to reduce some of that one-on-one morning support and redirects the funds to pay for support to join a weekly group swimming activity (Assistance with Social and Community Participation). This demonstrates the intended power of Core flexibility to adapt supports to evolving needs and goals. This adaptability contrasts sharply with the rigidity of Capacity Building budgets (where funds are locked within specific categories) and Capital budgets (where funds are tied to specific items).

### 5.2 Know the Boundaries: Key Limitations to Flexibility

Despite the general rule, several important limitations restrict the flexibility of the Core Supports budget:

- **Stated Supports:** Some funding within an NDIS plan, including potentially within the Core budget, may be designated as 'stated supports'. This means the funding has been allocated for a very specific purpose, item, service, or even a particular provider, often based on a quote. Funding for stated supports is **not flexible** and *must* be used exactly as described in the plan; it cannot be used to purchase different supports. Examples might include funding allocated for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA), specific high-cost assistive technology quoted within Core, or supports delivered under certain contractual arrangements like some Supported Independent Living (SIL) packages. Plans will clearly indicate when a support is stated.
- **Transport Funding:** As previously mentioned, transport funding often operates under specific rules and may not be fully flexible with other Core categories. Periodic transport payments, in particular, are often treated as stated or recurring and cannot typically be repurposed for other Core supports. Participants should always clarify the specific rules around their transport funding with their NDIS contact.
- **Other Specific Restrictions:** Flexibility can also be limited by funding allocated for specific purposes like Compensation (where funding relates to a compensation payment) or In-kind supports (where a service is pre-paid by a government agency).

### 5.3 Navigating the October 2024 Changes: Support Lists & Replacement Rule

Legislation changes effective from October 3, 2024, introduced further definition around how NDIS funding, including Core Supports, can be used.

- **NDIS Support Lists:** The most significant change is the introduction of formal **NDIS Support Lists**. These lists define what constitutes an 'NDIS support' – essentially, the items and services that NDIS funding *can* be used for. There is also a corresponding list of items and services that the NDIS *cannot* fund (e.g., day-to-day living costs unrelated to disability, illegal items, supports covered by other government systems).
- **Impact on Flexibility:** While the NDIS states these lists are largely based on existing guidance, their formalisation means participants must now ensure any purchase made with NDIS funds aligns with items on the approved 'NDIS supports' list. This introduces a clearer boundary for spending but may be perceived as reducing the previously assumed broader flexibility. Core supports remain generally flexible *within the confines* of purchasing items or services that are on the approved NDIS support list and are not otherwise restricted (e.g., stated supports).
- **Transition Period:** Recognizing the adjustment needed, a 12-month transition period (from October 2024) is in place. During this time, the NDIA aims to educate participants. Importantly, for genuine mistakes where a participant claims an item not on the support list (valued under $1,500), a debt will generally not be raised for the first or second instance, provided it's not an illegal purchase or part of fraudulent activity.
- **Substitution/Replacement Support Rule:** Alongside the lists, a 'replacement support' rule was introduced. This allows participants, in *specific circumstances*, to request funding for an item or service that is *not* on the standard NDIS support list, if they can demonstrate it represents better value for money and will achieve better outcomes related to their disability support needs than an available NDIS support. This rule provides a potential avenue for flexibility but requires justification and NDIA approval for very specific items. An example might involve funding a specific type of combined washer/dryer for someone whose disability makes standard laundry processes extremely difficult and reliant on support workers, where the appliance demonstrably increases independence and reduces ongoing support costs.

The evolution of flexibility rules, culminating in the October 2024 changes, highlights a continuous effort by the NDIS to strike a balance. The goal is to maintain participant choice and control while ensuring clarity, consistency, and the sustainable use of funds within the scheme's legislative framework. This increasing complexity necessitates that participants and their support networks stay informed to navigate the system effectively. Simply stating Core is flexible is no longer sufficient; understanding the conditions, limitations, and the new framework of support lists is essential.

### 5.4 How Plan Management Affects Flexibility

The way a participant chooses to manage their NDIS funding also influences the practical application of flexibility:

- **Self-Management:** Offers the greatest theoretical flexibility. Participants can use both registered and unregistered providers and can negotiate prices, potentially paying less than the NDIS price limit (though value for money must still be demonstrated). However, self-managers bear full responsibility for managing payments, keeping records for five years, and ensuring all spending aligns with their plan and NDIS rules (including the support lists).
- **Plan-Managed:** A plan manager is funded in the plan to handle the financial administration – paying providers, tracking budgets, and financial reporting. Participants can use both registered and unregistered providers, but the plan manager must generally adhere to the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits when paying providers. Flexibility exists across the Core categories managed this way.
- **NDIA-Managed (Agency-Managed):** The NDIA pays registered providers directly from the participant's plan. Participants using this option can *only* use NDIS-registered providers, and these providers must adhere to the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Flexibility exists across the Core categories managed this way.

An important practical constraint arises if a participant uses *different* management types for different Core support categories. For example, if 'Assistance with Daily Life' is NDIA-managed and 'Consumables' is Plan-managed, funds generally cannot be moved between these two categories, even though they are both within the Core budget. Flexibility typically only applies across categories that share the *same* fund management type.

## Managing Your Core Supports Funding Effectively

Successfully utilising the Core Supports budget involves more than just knowing the categories and flexibility rules; it requires proactive management to ensure funds are used appropriately, deliver value, and last for the duration of the NDIS plan. Effective budget management is intrinsically linked to understanding NDIS rules and requires active engagement from the participant or their support network.

### 6.1 Understanding NDIS Pricing: Value for Money & Price Limits

All NDIS supports, including those funded under Core, must meet the 'reasonable and necessary' criteria outlined in the NDIS Act. A key component of this is demonstrating 'value for money'. This doesn't simply mean choosing the cheapest option, but rather ensuring the cost of a support is reasonable relative to both the benefits it provides the participant and the cost of alternative support options that could achieve the same outcome.

To assist participants and providers, and to ensure consistency and value, the NDIA publishes the **NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits (PAPL)** and the **NDIS Support Catalogue**.

- The **PAPL** outlines the rules for claiming payments for supports.
- The **Support Catalogue** lists specific support items with unique reference numbers and, crucially, sets the **maximum price** that NDIS-registered providers can charge for many supports when delivering services to participants whose funding is NDIA-managed or Plan-managed.

It is vital to remember that these are *price limits*, not fixed prices. Participants and providers are encouraged to negotiate rates, and providers may charge less than the maximum limit. Participants who self-manage their funding are not strictly bound by these price limits when using unregistered providers, but they still must ensure the supports represent value for money. Pricing arrangements and limits are subject to regular review and updates by the NDIA, including annual reviews and indexation adjustments, so consulting the latest versions on the NDIS website is essential.

### 6.2 Budget Allocation and Tracking

Participants hold the primary responsibility for managing their NDIS budget to ensure the allocated funding is sufficient to cover their support needs for the entire duration of their plan. Recent legislative changes (October 2024) also emphasize managing funds within specific 'funding periods' if these are stipulated in the plan.

Effective tracking is key. Participants can monitor their spending and remaining balances through:

- The **my NDIS portal** or the **my NDIS mobile app**.
- Regular statements provided by their **Plan Manager** (if applicable).

Practical tips for budget tracking include:

- Creating a simple spreadsheet or using budgeting tools to map out planned expenditure against allocated funds.
- Diligently keeping records of all invoices and receipts for supports purchased. This is a mandatory requirement for self-managers, who must retain these records for five years, but it is good practice for all participants.
- Regularly reviewing spending patterns (e.g., monthly) to ensure they align with the budget and the plan duration.
- Negotiating service agreements with providers clearly outlining costs, schedules, and cancellation policies.

### 6.3 Avoiding Overspending and Underspending

Proactive budget management helps prevent the stressful situation of running out of funds before the plan ends. It's important to understand that the NDIS does not automatically conduct a plan review or provide additional funding simply because a budget has been fully spent.

- **Anticipating Overspending:** If a participant foresees that their Core funding may not be sufficient for the plan duration, often due to a significant change in circumstances or support needs, they should act promptly. The first step is to discuss the situation with their Local Area Coordinator (LAC), NDIA planner, or Support Coordinator. They may need to request a plan change or reassessment (previously known as a plan review). Crucially, such a request must be supported by evidence demonstrating a genuine change in needs that warrants different or additional reasonable and necessary supports. While waiting for the request to be assessed, participants are encouraged to utilise the existing flexibility within their Core budget (where possible) to manage their immediate needs.
- **Addressing Underspending:** Consistently underspending the Core budget also warrants attention. It may indicate that the participant's needs are being met with less support than anticipated, which is positive information for future planning. However, it could also signal barriers to accessing needed supports, dissatisfaction with current providers, or a lack of understanding about how the funds can be used. Discussing underspending with an NDIS contact can help identify the reasons and ensure the participant is receiving the appropriate level and type of support to pursue their goals.

Ultimately, managing the Core budget effectively requires more than just arithmetic; it demands an understanding of the interconnected NDIS rules—pricing, flexibility, reasonable and necessary criteria, support lists—and proactive monitoring and communication.

## Maximising Your Core Supports: Practical Tips & Examples

While the rules and categories provide the structure for Core Supports, the real value lies in how this funding is applied to enhance a participant's daily life and help them achieve their goals. Thinking creatively and strategically about how to use Core funding (within the established boundaries) can unlock significant opportunities for increased independence and participation. Practical, scenario-based examples help bridge the gap between the abstract rules and real-world application.

Here are some ways Core Supports might be utilised effectively:

- **Enhancing Social Connection:** A participant aiming to reduce social isolation could use funding from 'Assistance with Social and Community Participation'. This might involve engaging a support worker to provide transport and assistance to join a local book club, attend community centre classes (like art or pottery), participate in a team sport, or simply meet friends regularly at a cafe. The support facilitates access and engagement in mainstream community life.
- **Boosting Independence at Home:** A participant wanting to increase their self-sufficiency in daily tasks could use their 'Consumables' budget for low-cost assistive technology. This could include items like talking clocks or calendars, specialised reminder apps on a tablet (if deemed reasonable and necessary for disability needs), long-handled reaching tools, adapted cooking utensils, or non-slip mats for the bathroom. These small investments can significantly reduce reliance on direct support for certain tasks.
- **Tailored Support for Specific Needs (e.g., Autism):** While NDIS supports are based on individual functional needs rather than diagnosis alone, Core funding can be tailored. For an individual on the autism spectrum, 'Assistance with Daily Life' might fund a support worker with specific experience in autism to help establish predictable daily routines or manage sensory sensitivities during personal care. 'Assistance with Social and Community Participation' could fund support to attend social skills groups, navigate busy community environments, or participate in preferred recreational activities with appropriate assistance. Low-cost AT under 'Consumables' might include visual schedules or communication aids.
- **Leveraging Flexibility:** A participant might find their needs change during their plan. For instance, they might decide they need less support with household cleaning ('Assistance with Daily Life') for a period and wish to prioritise attending a specific community event. Using the flexibility of the Core budget (assuming funds are not stated and share the same management type), they could reduce cleaning hours and allocate those funds towards paying a support worker ('Assistance with Social and Community Participation') to accompany them to the event.

To maximise the potential of Core Supports:

- **Communicate Regularly:** Maintain open communication with the NDIS planner, LAC, Support Coordinator (if funded), or Plan Manager. Discuss how current supports are working, whether needs are being met, and explore different ways Core funding could be used to better align with goals.
- **Stay Informed:** Keep abreast of NDIS rules, particularly regarding the Support Lists introduced in October 2024. Before purchasing items or services, especially less common ones, check if they align with the approved NDIS supports.
- **Focus on Goals:** Regularly revisit personal goals outlined in the NDIS plan and consider how Core Supports can be strategically employed as stepping stones towards achieving them.

By understanding the scope and rules, and by thinking creatively about application, participants can transform their Core Supports budget from a simple allocation of funds into a powerful tool for enhancing independence, participation, and overall well-being.

## Conclusion: Taking Control of Your NDIS Core Supports

The NDIS Core Supports budget is a fundamental resource designed to empower participants by funding the essential supports needed for everyday life and community engagement. Navigating this funding effectively requires understanding its distinct purpose compared to Capacity Building and Capital budgets, and appreciating the specific functions of its four key categories: Assistance with Daily Life, Consumables, Assistance with Social and Community Participation, and Transport.

While generally offering the most flexibility within the NDIS funding structure, Core Supports operate within important boundaries. Participants must be aware of limitations such as stated supports, specific rules governing transport funding, and the formalised NDIS Support Lists introduced in October 2024, which define permissible spending. The introduction of the replacement support rule offers a pathway for exceptions in specific circumstances, adding another layer to navigate.

Effective management is paramount. This involves not only tracking expenditure against the allocated budget and plan duration but also ensuring all purchased supports meet the reasonable and necessary criteria, represent value for money, and align with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits where applicable. Proactive communication with NDIS contacts and diligent record-keeping are crucial elements of successful budget management.

Ultimately, knowledge is power. By understanding the structure, rules, and potential applications of the Core Supports budget, NDIS participants, along with their families and support networks, are better equipped to make informed choices. This understanding facilitates the strategic use of funding to meet immediate needs, adapt to changing circumstances, and make tangible progress towards personal goals. Taking control of Core Supports is a key step towards harnessing the full potential of the NDIS to foster independence, enhance participation, and improve quality of life. Participants are encouraged to ask questions, seek clarification from their LAC, planner, or support coordinator, and utilise the available resources to confidently navigate their NDIS journey.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are NDIS Core Supports?
NDIS Core Supports are funds provided to help participants with everyday activities and current disability-related needs. They're the most flexible category of NDIS funding and are divided into four categories: Assistance with Daily Life, Consumables, Assistance with Social and Community Participation, and Transport.

### Can I use my Core Supports funding for anything I want?
No, while Core Supports are flexible, all purchases must be on the NDIS Support Lists (formalized in October 2024), meet the 'reasonable and necessary' criteria, and be related to your disability support needs. Some funding may also be designated as 'stated supports' which must be used for specific purposes only.

### What's the difference between Core Supports and Capacity Building Supports?
Core Supports focus on your current everyday needs, while Capacity Building Supports aim to build your skills and independence for the future. Core funding is generally flexible between categories, whereas Capacity Building funding must be used within the specific category it was allocated for.

### Can I move money between different Core Support categories?
Generally yes, Core Supports offer flexibility to move funds between categories (like from Daily Life to Consumables), provided the funds aren't designated as 'stated supports' and share the same management type (e.g., both self-managed or both plan-managed).

### What happens if I don't use all my Core Supports funding?
Unused funds don't automatically roll over to your next plan. Consistent underspending may result in reduced funding in future plans, as it suggests you don't need all the allocated supports. However, underspending shouldn't be viewed negatively if your needs have genuinely changed.

### How do I know if something is covered under NDIS Core Supports?
You can check the NDIS Support Lists on the NDIS website, consult the NDIS Price Guide and Support Catalogue, or discuss with your Support Coordinator, LAC, or NDIS planner. If you're unsure about a specific purchase, it's always best to check before spending the funds.
