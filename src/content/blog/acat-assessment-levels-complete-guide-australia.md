Understanding **ACAT assessment levels** is crucial for accessing home care support in Australia. The Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) determines your eligibility for government-funded aged care services, including **home care packages**. This comprehensive guide explains the four **ACAT levels**, what each provides, funding amounts, and how to navigate the assessment process in 2025.

## What are ACAT Assessment Levels?

Each level provides different types of support and varying amounts of government funding to help older Australians remain living independently at home.
