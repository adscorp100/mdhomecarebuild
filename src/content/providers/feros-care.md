# Feros Care

We're an award-winning, all-inclusive, not-for-profit organisation trusted by thousands of Australians.

## About This Provider

Feros Care is a trusted aged care provider and NDIS partner delivering services across Australia. Whether it's through our work as an aged care provider, or with our Disability and Community Development services (NDIS local area coordination), we're here to work with you in your local community, provide quality care, and ensure that you feel heard. Then we do everything we can to help you achieve your goals and ambitions – whatever they might look like for you.

Our founder, George Feros, was a proud Kytherian-Australian man. He walked the streets of Byron Bay, armed with a wooden collection box and a brass bell, raising money to fund an organisation where medical care and community spirit could combine to support those in need. And over three decades later, we're still making George proud.
