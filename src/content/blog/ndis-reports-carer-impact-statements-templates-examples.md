## Understanding Carer Impact Statements

### What is a Carer Impact Statement?

A carer impact statement is a detailed document that describes how caring for a person with disability affects the carer's life, health, wellbeing, and ability to participate in work, education, and community activities. These statements provide crucial evidence for NDIS planning and funding decisions.

**Purpose of Carer Impact Statements:**
- Demonstrate the need for formal supports to reduce carer burden
- Provide evidence for respite and family support funding
- Support applications for increased support hours
- Document changes in carer circumstances over time
- Justify specific types of support interventions

### Types of Carer Impact Statements

**Primary Carer Impact Statement**
- Focuses on the main carer (usually parent, spouse, or partner)
- Comprehensive assessment of caring responsibilities
- Detailed impact on physical and mental health
- Effect on employment, education, and social participation

**Family Impact Statement**
- Broader assessment including siblings, extended family
- Impact on family dynamics and relationships
- Effect on children's development and opportunities
- Whole-of-family support needs assessment

**Multiple Carer Impact Statement**
- When care is shared between several people
- Coordination challenges and support needs
- Individual and collective impact assessment
- Support distribution and planning considerations

## Carer Impact Statement Template

### Section 1: Carer Information
**Personal Details:**
- Name, age, and relationship to NDIS participant
- Employment status and work arrangements
- Education level and current study commitments
- Health conditions and medical needs
- Other caring responsibilities

**Example:**
*"I am Sarah Johnson, 42 years old, and the primary carer for my 16-year-old son Michael who has autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. I work part-time as a nurse (20 hours per week) and have had to reduce my hours significantly since Michael's needs increased. I also care for my elderly mother who lives nearby and requires weekly support."*

### Section 2: Daily Caring Responsibilities
**Morning Routine (5:00 AM - 9:00 AM):**
- Personal care assistance required
- Medication administration
- Meal preparation and feeding support
- Behavioral support and routine management
- Transport arrangements

**Example:**
*"Michael requires full assistance with personal hygiene, including showering, teeth brushing, and dressing. This takes 45-60 minutes each morning. He needs constant supervision during breakfast due to choking risks and requires his medication to be administered precisely at 7:00 AM. Behavioral support is needed to manage transitions and prevent meltdowns that can last 30-45 minutes."*

### Section 3: Impact on Physical Health
**Physical Demands:**
- Lifting, transferring, and mobility assistance
- Sleep disruption and fatigue
- Stress-related health conditions
- Injuries from caring activities
- Medical appointments and treatments

**Example:**
*"I experience chronic back pain from lifting Michael (65kg) multiple times daily for transfers and personal care. Sleep is disrupted 3-4 nights per week due to his sleep disturbances and night-time seizures. I have developed anxiety and depression, requiring medication and counseling. My GP has recommended I reduce physical caring demands to prevent further injury."*

### Section 4: Impact on Mental Health and Wellbeing
**Emotional Impact:**
- Stress, anxiety, and depression
- Social isolation and loneliness
- Grief and loss related to disability
- Worry about the future
- Relationship strain

**Example:**
*"The constant vigilance required for Michael's safety has led to severe anxiety. I rarely leave the house without him and have lost contact with most friends. I worry constantly about his future and what will happen when I can no longer care for him. My marriage has been strained, and my husband and I rarely have time together without Michael present."*

### Section 5: Impact on Employment and Education
**Work-Related Impacts:**
- Reduced hours or career changes
- Frequent absences for appointments
- Inability to work certain shifts
- Career progression limitations
- Financial impact

**Example:**
*"I have been unable to work full-time since Michael was diagnosed. Frequent medical appointments, school meetings, and behavioral crises require me to leave work unexpectedly. I have declined promotion opportunities that would require travel or evening work. Our family income has reduced by 60% since I reduced my working hours."*

### Section 6: Impact on Social and Community Participation
**Social Isolation:**
- Reduced social activities and friendships
- Inability to participate in community events
- Limited family outings and holidays
- Restricted recreational activities
- Impact on other family members

**Example:**
*"Family outings are rare due to Michael's behavioral needs and sensory sensitivities. We cannot attend community events, family gatherings, or social functions. My younger daughter has missed birthday parties and school events because I cannot arrange appropriate care for Michael. Our family has become increasingly isolated from our community."*

## NDIS Impact Statement Examples

### Impact Statement for Initial NDIS Application

**Participant:** Emma, 8 years old, cerebral palsy and intellectual disability

**Daily Life Impact:**
*"Emma requires total assistance with all personal care activities including feeding, bathing, dressing, and toileting. She cannot be left unsupervised at any time due to safety risks from her mobility limitations and cognitive impairment. Emma uses a wheelchair for mobility and requires assistance with all transfers. Communication is limited to basic gestures and sounds, requiring constant interpretation of her needs."*

**Family Impact:**
*"As Emma's primary carer, I provide 24/7 supervision and care. Sleep is disrupted nightly due to Emma's positioning needs and discomfort. I cannot work outside the home and have had to decline employment opportunities. Emma's father works extended hours to compensate for lost income. Our 10-year-old son often helps with Emma's care and has taken on responsibilities beyond his years."*

**Community Participation Impact:**
*"Emma cannot participate in typical childhood activities without extensive support. Playground equipment is inaccessible, and she requires one-on-one supervision for safety. Family outings require significant planning and specialized equipment. Emma cannot attend mainstream childcare or participate in community programs without additional support workers."*

### Impact Statement for Plan Review

**Participant:** David, 35 years old, acquired brain injury

**Changes Since Last Plan:**
*"David's cognitive function has declined over the past year, with increased confusion and memory problems. He now requires prompting for all daily activities and cannot be left alone for more than 30 minutes. Previously, he could prepare simple meals independently; now he requires constant supervision in the kitchen due to safety risks."*

**Increased Support Needs:**
*"David's behavioral changes include increased agitation and aggression, particularly in the evenings. He requires specialized behavior support and has had three emergency department visits this year due to behavioral incidents. His sleep patterns are severely disrupted, requiring night-time supervision and support."*

**Carer Impact Changes:**
*"As David's wife and primary carer, I have had to leave my full-time job to provide increased supervision. The stress of managing his behavioral changes has affected my own mental health, and I am now receiving counseling support. Our teenage children are reluctant to bring friends home due to David's unpredictable behavior."*

## Writing Effective Impact Statements

### Key Principles for Effective Documentation

**Be Specific and Detailed:**
- Use concrete examples rather than general statements
- Include specific times, frequencies, and durations
- Describe actual incidents and situations
- Quantify impacts where possible

**Focus on Functional Impact:**
- Describe how disability affects daily activities
- Explain limitations in community participation
- Detail support needs and assistance required
- Connect disability to specific support requirements

**Use Person-First Language:**
- Focus on the person, not the disability
- Avoid negative or deficit-focused language
- Emphasize strengths and potential
- Maintain dignity and respect throughout

**Provide Evidence:**
- Include relevant medical reports and assessments
- Reference professional recommendations
- Use standardized assessment tools where appropriate
- Include photos or videos if relevant and consented

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Vague or General Statements:**
- ❌ "John has difficulty with daily activities"
- ✅ "John requires physical assistance to transfer from his wheelchair to the toilet, shower, and bed, with transfers taking 10-15 minutes each and requiring two people for safety"

**Focusing Only on Deficits:**
- ❌ "Sarah cannot do anything independently"
- ✅ "Sarah demonstrates strong motivation to learn new skills and has successfully mastered using her communication device to express basic needs and preferences"

**Lack of Specific Examples:**
- ❌ "The family is stressed"
- ✅ "I have been unable to sleep more than 3 consecutive hours for the past 6 months due to Tom's night-time seizures, requiring me to check on him every 2 hours and provide repositioning assistance"
