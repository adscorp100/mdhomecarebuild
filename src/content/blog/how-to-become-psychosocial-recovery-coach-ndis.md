## What Is a Psychosocial Recovery Coach?

A psychosocial recovery coach is a specialised NDIS provider who works with participants experiencing psychosocial disability arising from mental health conditions. Unlike general [support coordinators](/blog/what-does-a-support-coordinator-do-in-the-ndis), recovery coaches focus specifically on mental health recovery principles.

> **Recovery coaches help participants take charge of their own recovery journey through evidence-based approaches and practical NDIS support.**

The role was introduced to the NDIS in July 2020 to address the unique needs of over 64,000 participants with primary psychosocial disability.

**What Recovery Coaches Do**

- Identify personal strengths and set meaningful recovery goals
- Develop practical skills for daily living and community participation
- Navigate both the NDIS and mental health service systems
- Build capacity to self-manage aspects of their lives
- Connect with appropriate services and community resources
- Reduce reliance on clinical supports where appropriate

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to become a psychosocial recovery coach?

The typical pathway takes 2-3 years: 6-12 months for Certificate IV completion plus 2 years of required experience. Those with existing mental health qualifications or experience may qualify sooner.

### Can I work as a recovery coach without a qualification?

No. Minimum requirements include a Certificate IV in Mental Health or equivalent, plus two years of relevant experience. All recovery coaches must be registered with the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission.

### What is the difference between a recovery coach and a support coordinator?

Recovery coaches specialise in mental health recovery with specific expertise in psychosocial disability. [Support coordinators](/blog/what-does-a-support-coordinator-do-in-the-ndis) work across all disability types with a broader coordination focus. Recovery coaches typically provide more intensive, recovery-oriented support using trauma-informed approaches.

### Can I be both a peer support worker and a recovery coach?

Yes, but keep the roles distinct with separate billing arrangements. Some providers caution against providing both services to the same participant due to potential conflicts of interest.

### Is there demand for recovery coaches in regional areas?

Yes, regional areas often have significant unmet demand. Many participants in rural NSW, Queensland, and Western Australia face waiting lists of 3-6 months for recovery coaching services. Telehealth delivery options are expanding access.

### Do I need lived experience to become a recovery coach?

Lived experience is highly valued but not mandatory. The professional qualification pathway allows those without personal mental health experience to enter the role through formal qualifications and work experience.

### How do I find participants as a self-employed recovery coach?

Build relationships with support coordinators and plan managers who can refer participants. Register on the NDIS provider marketplace, create a professional website, and network within mental health and disability service communities.
