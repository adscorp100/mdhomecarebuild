## Key Points

- Support coordinators must submit progress reports at key milestones: 8-week initial implementation, mid-term review, and end-of-plan assessment
- Three main report types serve different purposes: demonstrating plan implementation, tracking goal progress, and justifying future funding
- The PACE system introduced in 2024-2026 has new reporting requirements and submission pathways through the myNDIS portal
- Quality reports focus on participant outcomes, measurable goal progress, and evidence-based recommendations for future support needs

## What is a Support Coordinator Progress Report?

A support coordinator progress report is a formal document submitted to the NDIA that details how a participant's NDIS plan has been implemented and the outcomes achieved during the reporting period. These reports serve as critical evidence of service delivery quality, participant progress, and the effectiveness of funded supports.

Progress reports are essential for several reasons:

- **Accountability**: They demonstrate how NDIS funding has been used effectively
- **Evidence gathering**: They provide documentation for plan reviews and funding decisions
- **Communication**: They keep the NDIA informed about participant circumstances and changing needs
- **Quality assurance**: They show that support coordination is delivering value for participants
- **Future planning**: They inform recommendations for upcoming NDIS plans

The NDIA now requires support coordinators (both registered and unregistered) to submit reports through the **myNDIS provider portal** as part of the PACE system rollout. The new standardised templates replace the previous ad-hoc reporting formats, helping NDIA planners prepare for check-ins and plan reassessments with consistent, structured information. Both the progress report and implementation report templates are available for download from the [NDIS support coordinator page](https://www.ndis.gov.au/providers/working-provider/support-coordinators-and-our-new-computer-system).

> **Important**: Quality progress reports significantly influence plan review outcomes. NDIA planners rely heavily on support coordinator reports when making funding decisions.

## Types of Support Coordinator Reports

Support coordinators submit different types of reports throughout a participant's NDIS plan period. Each serves a specific purpose and has unique requirements.

### 1. Initial Plan Implementation Report (8-Week Report)

The 8-week report is submitted approximately eight weeks after a participant's NDIS plan commences. This critical report demonstrates that initial plan implementation is underway and identifies any early challenges.

**When to Submit**: 6-8 weeks after plan start date

**Purpose**:
- Confirm services have been connected
- Report on initial provider engagement
- Identify any implementation barriers
- Flag concerns about plan adequacy early
- Document participant engagement in the process

**Key Elements to Include**:

| Section | What to Document |
|---------|------------------|
| Services Connected | List all providers engaged, service types, and start dates |
| Services Pending | Note any supports not yet in place with reasons |
| Initial Goal Progress | Early indicators of progress toward NDIS goals |
| Participant Engagement | How the participant has been involved in implementation |
| Early Challenges | Any barriers encountered and actions taken |
| Budget Status | Projected utilization patterns and any concerns |

**Example 8-Week Report Opening**:

> "This report covers the first 8 weeks of [Participant Name]'s NDIS plan (Plan dates: [Start] to [End]). During this period, support coordination has focused on establishing essential supports and connecting [Participant Name] with quality providers aligned with their stated goals."

### 2. Mid-Term Implementation Report

The mid-term report provides a checkpoint halfway through the plan period, allowing for course corrections and documenting ongoing progress.

**When to Submit**: Approximately 6 months into a 12-month plan (or 12 months into a 24-month plan)

**Purpose**:
- Review progress against all NDIS goals
- Assess service effectiveness
- Identify any required adjustments to supports
- Document changes in participant circumstances
- Provide early evidence for plan review

**Key Elements to Include**:
- Comprehensive goal progress assessment
- Service delivery quality evaluation
- Budget utilization analysis
- Participant satisfaction feedback
- Mainstream service integration updates
- Capacity building outcomes
- Recommendations for remaining plan period

### 3. Plan Reassessment/End of Plan Review Report

The end-of-plan report is the most comprehensive document, providing a full summary of the plan period and making evidence-based recommendations for the next NDIS plan.

**When to Submit**: 4-6 weeks before plan end date or plan review meeting

**Purpose**:
- Provide complete summary of plan implementation
- Document all goal outcomes with evidence
- Justify recommendations for future supports
- Identify changed circumstances or emerging needs
- Support participant's plan review preparation

> **Critical**: The end-of-plan report is your most influential document. NDIA planners often base significant funding decisions on the quality and comprehensiveness of this report.

---

## What to Include in Each Report

Regardless of report type, certain elements should be consistently included to meet NDIS requirements and support positive participant outcomes.

### Participant Information

Every report must include accurate participant details:

- **Full name** and preferred name
- **NDIS number** (participant reference number)
- **Plan dates** (current plan start and end dates)
- **Plan management type** (NDIA-managed, plan-managed, or self-managed)
- **Report period** (dates covered by this report)
- **Support coordination level** (Support Connection, Coordination, or Specialist)
- **Support coordinator details** (name, organization, contact information)

### Implementation Details

Document the practical aspects of plan implementation:

**Services Established**:
- Provider name and registration status
- Service type and support category
- Frequency and hours of service
- Service agreement status
- Service start date

**Coordination Activities**:
- Number and type of contacts with participant
- Provider meetings and communications
- Mainstream service liaison
- Crisis or issue resolution activities
- Capacity building activities delivered

**Example Implementation Summary**:

| Provider | Service Type | Category | Weekly Hours | Status |
|----------|--------------|----------|--------------|--------|
| ABC Support Services | Personal care | Core - Daily Living | 10 hours | Active since 15/02/2026 |
| XYZ Therapy | Occupational therapy | CB - Daily Living | 1 hour | Active since 22/02/2026 |
| Community Connect | Social participation | Core - Community | 4 hours | Active since 01/03/2026 |
| Assistive Tech Co | Equipment supply | Capital - AT | One-off | Quote pending |

### Progress Toward Goals

Goal progress documentation is the heart of any support coordinator report. For each NDIS plan goal:

**Goal Statement**: Quote the goal exactly as written in the NDIS plan

**Baseline**: Where the participant started at plan commencement

**Current Status**: Where they are now, with specific measurable indicators

**Evidence**: Concrete examples of progress or regression

**Contributing Factors**: What has helped or hindered progress

**Participant Perspective**: How the participant views their progress

**Rating Scale Example**:

| Progress Level | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Fully Achieved | Goal completely met, participant satisfied |
| Significant Progress | Major improvements, approaching full achievement |
| Moderate Progress | Clear positive movement, continuing work needed |
| Limited Progress | Some improvement but barriers remain |
| No Progress | No measurable change from baseline |
| Regression | Situation has worsened, requiring intervention |

**Detailed Goal Progress Example**:

> **Goal**: "I want to be more independent with my daily routines"
>
> **Baseline**: At plan commencement, [Participant] required full support with morning routines including personal care, meal preparation, and medication management. They were unable to complete any routine tasks independently.
>
> **Current Status**: After 6 months of support, [Participant] now independently manages their morning personal care routine and prepares simple breakfast items. They use a visual schedule developed with their OT and can follow the sequence without prompting. Medication management remains supported.
>
> **Evidence**: Support worker daily logs show reduction from 2 hours to 45 minutes morning support. OT report dated 15/04/2026 confirms skill development. Participant demonstrated routine during home visit on 20/04/2026.
>
> **Progress Rating**: Significant Progress
>
> **Participant Statement**: "[Participant] expressed pride in their achievements: 'I can do my shower myself now and make my toast. I feel more grown up.'"

### Challenges and Barriers

Honest reporting of challenges is essential for accurate NDIA understanding and appropriate future funding:

**Types of Barriers to Document**:
- Provider availability or workforce issues
- Service gaps in the participant's area
- Transport or access barriers
- Participant health or circumstance changes
- Family or living situation challenges
- Funding adequacy issues
- Service quality concerns

**How to Document Challenges**:

1. **Describe the barrier clearly**: What specifically was the problem?
2. **Explain impact on goals**: How did this affect progress?
3. **Document actions taken**: What did you do to address it?
4. **Note outcome**: Was the issue resolved? What remains outstanding?
5. **Provide recommendations**: What would help in the future?

> **Tip**: Never minimize challenges. Accurate reporting of barriers helps the NDIA understand real-world plan implementation difficulties and informs policy decisions.

### Future Recommendations

Recommendations should be evidence-based and linked directly to documented outcomes:

**Strong Recommendation Example**:

> "Based on [Participant]'s demonstrated progress in daily living skills and their stated goal of independent living, we recommend:
>
> 1. **Continuation of OT services** (2 hours/fortnight) to consolidate gains and work on advanced meal preparation and household management
> 2. **Increase in community participation hours** from 4 to 8 hours weekly to support [Participant]'s expressed desire for increased social connections and community involvement
> 3. **Exploration of Supported Independent Living** options, with SIL assessment to be completed in next plan period
> 4. **Reduction in support coordination hours** from 100 to 60 hours, as [Participant] has developed strong self-advocacy skills and provider relationships"

## PACE System Reporting Updates (2024-2026)

The NDIA's PACE (Provider and Participant Access Checking and Enquiry) system, rolled out progressively through 2024-2026, has introduced significant changes to how support coordinator reports are submitted and processed.

### Key PACE Changes for Support Coordinators

**Digital Submission Requirements**:
- Reports can now be submitted directly through the myNDIS provider portal
- Standardized formatting requirements for upload
- Automatic acknowledgment and tracking
- Secure document storage and retrieval

**New Template Requirements**:

The PACE system prefers structured reports that can be processed efficiently. Key formatting requirements include:

- Clear section headings matching NDIA categories
- Participant information in standard format
- Goal progress using consistent rating scales
- Quantifiable data where possible (hours, percentages, dates)
- Explicit linking of evidence to goals

**Submission Pathways**:

| Method | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| myNDIS Portal Upload | Standard report submissions, routine updates |
| Email to Planner | When portal unavailable or urgent matters |
| Plan Review Meeting | Presenting summary with detailed report provided beforehand |
| NDIA Contact Centre | Follow-up queries, submission confirmation |

### PACE System Timeline Considerations

Under PACE, the following timeline guidance applies:

- **8-week report**: Submit within 6-8 weeks of plan start
- **Mid-term report**: Submit at plan midpoint (automatically flagged in portal)
- **End-of-plan report**: Submit 4-6 weeks before plan end date
- **Urgent reports**: Can be submitted anytime for critical changes or concerns

> **PACE Portal Tip**: Save reports in PDF format before uploading. The portal accepts Word documents but PDF ensures formatting is preserved.

## Sample Support Coordinator Progress Report (Full Example)

The following is a complete worked example of an end-of-plan report:

---

**SUPPORT COORDINATOR PROGRESS REPORT**

**Report Type**: End of Plan Review

**Participant Name**: Sarah Mitchell (preferred: Sarah)
**NDIS Number**: 123456789
**Plan Dates**: 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2025
**Report Period**: 1 July 2024 to 15 May 2025
**Report Date**: 20 May 2025

**Support Coordinator**: Jane Williams
**Organization**: Community Care Coordination Services
**Phone**: 03 9876 5432
**Email**: jane.w@cccs.org.au

---

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This end-of-plan report covers Sarah Mitchell's 12-month NDIS plan. During this period, Sarah has made significant progress toward her goals of increased independence and community participation. All planned services have been successfully established, with Sarah engaging consistently with her support team.

Key achievements include Sarah developing independent travel skills (now catching public transport to her day program unaccompanied), increasing her social connections through a community art group, and building self-advocacy skills demonstrated by her participation in this plan review process.

Challenges included initial difficulties finding an occupational therapist with availability, which was resolved by Month 3, and a three-week service gap when Sarah's support worker resigned unexpectedly.

Recommendations for the next plan include continuation of current successful supports with modest increases in community participation hours and commencement of employment exploration supports aligned with Sarah's stated goal of finding paid work.

---

**SECTION 3: GOAL PROGRESS**

**Goal 1**: "I want to use public transport to get places on my own"

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Baseline** | At plan start, Sarah had never travelled independently. She relied on support worker transport for all community access. She expressed anxiety about public transport and had no experience purchasing tickets or reading timetables. |
| **Current Status** | Sarah now travels independently by bus to her day program (Route 503) three times per week. She uses a Myki card, understands timetables, and has a backup plan if she misses her bus. She has also made two independent trips to the local shopping center. |
| **Progress Rating** | Significant Progress |
| **Evidence** | Travel training report from Access Skills Training (attached) documents 12 training sessions and sign-off on Route 503. Support worker logs confirm independent travel commenced 12 March 2025. Sarah's Myki travel history shows 45 independent trips in the past 10 weeks. |
| **Contributing Factors** | Sarah's high motivation and the patient approach of her travel trainer were key success factors. Her family's willingness to let her take positive risks supported this progress. |
| **Participant Perspective** | Sarah stated: "I love catching the bus. I feel like a proper adult now. I want to learn more routes so I can visit my friends." |
| **Recommendation** | Continue travel training (4 hours/month) to expand to additional routes including Route 508 to shopping precinct and Route 512 to TAFE where Sarah hopes to study. |

**Goal 2**: "I want to make more friends and do fun activities"

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Baseline** | At plan start, Sarah's social connections were limited to family and paid workers. She attended a day program but reported having no friends there. She expressed loneliness and desire for genuine friendships. |
| **Current Status** | Sarah now attends a community art group every Saturday morning (not NDIS-funded, mainstream community program). She has formed a friendship with two other group members and exchanges text messages with them during the week. She also reports improved relationships at her day program. |
| **Progress Rating** | Fully Achieved |
| **Evidence** | Community art group attendance records (attached). Sarah's phone shows regular text conversations with friends. Day program progress report notes improved social engagement. Participant demonstrated friendships during support coordinator visit to art group. |
| **Contributing Factors** | Art group recommendation came from Sarah's occupational therapist who identified Sarah's artistic interests. Support worker initially accompanied Sarah to build confidence, then stepped back. |
| **Participant Perspective** | Sarah beamed when discussing her friends: "Maria and Julie are my best friends now. We're going to have a girls' night soon - watch movies and paint our nails!" |
| **Recommendation** | Continue current community participation funding to maintain day program and support Sarah's community connections. Consider reducing support worker accompaniment as Sarah's confidence grows. |

---

**SECTION 5: CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS**

| Challenge | Impact on Goals | Actions Taken | Outcome | Recommendation |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|---------|----------------|
| OT waitlist (3 months) | Delayed travel training start | Contacted 4 providers, advocated for priority, explored telehealth options | OT engagement commenced Month 3 | Earlier referrals in next plan, maintain relationship with current provider |
| Support worker resignation | 3-week service gap in personal care | Arranged family backup, fast-tracked recruitment, provided intensive support during transition | New worker started within 3 weeks, good rapport established | Build roster depth with backup workers, document detailed handover processes |
| Transport to art group | Initial barrier to community access | Negotiated trial support worker transport, then transitioned to independent travel once route mastered | Sarah now travels independently | Continue building Sarah's travel independence across multiple routes |

---

**SECTION 8: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE PLAN**

**Recommended Support Levels**

| Support Type | Current Funding | Recommended | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Core - Daily Living | $25,000 | $25,000 | Current level meeting needs effectively |
| Core - Community Participation | $8,000 | $12,000 | Increase to support employment exploration and expanded community activities |
| CB - Daily Living (OT) | $3,500 | $2,000 | Reduced as travel training goals largely achieved |
| CB - Support Coordination | $6,500 | $5,000 | Reduced as Sarah's self-advocacy skills have improved and provider relationships stable |
| CB - Employment | $0 | $5,000 | New goal: Sarah has expressed strong desire to explore paid work |

**Key Recommendations Summary**:

1. **Continue current successful supports** with stable, quality providers who have developed strong relationships with Sarah
2. **Add employment supports** through School Leaver Employment Supports (SLES) or equivalent, aligned with Sarah's expressed interest in working at an art gallery or craft store
3. **Expand travel training** to additional routes supporting employment and education goals
4. **Reduce support coordination** reflecting Sarah's growing independence and advocacy skills
5. **Explore TAFE options** for art-related courses to build toward employment goals

---

**SECTION 9: PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGMENT**

Sarah and her mother (informal supporter) reviewed this report on 18 May 2025. Sarah confirmed she agrees with the contents and is excited about the employment goal being included in her next plan.

Participant acknowledgment: [X] Yes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Support coordinators should be aware of these frequent reporting pitfalls:

### 1. Vague Goal Progress Statements

**Mistake**: "Sarah is making good progress with her independence goal."

**Better**: "Sarah now independently completes her morning routine in 45 minutes, compared to requiring 2 hours of full support at plan commencement. Evidence includes support worker logs showing task completion times and OT functional assessment dated 15/04/2026."

### 2. Missing Participant Voice

**Mistake**: Writing reports entirely in third person without participant quotes or perspectives.

**Better**: Include direct quotes from participants about their experience, progress, and priorities. This demonstrates person-centered practice and gives the NDIA insight into participant satisfaction.

### 3. Failure to Link Evidence to Goals

**Mistake**: Attaching provider reports without explaining their relevance.

**Better**: "The attached OT report (dated 15/04/2026) provides evidence for Goal 1 progress, specifically the functional assessment on page 3 that documents Sarah's improved daily living skills."

### 4. Ignoring Underutilization

**Mistake**: Not addressing why significant funding remains unused.

**Better**: Explain reasons for underspending (provider availability, participant circumstances, service gaps) and actions taken to address the issue.

### 5. Last-Minute Reporting

**Mistake**: Writing reports the day before plan review meetings.

**Better**: Allow 2-3 weeks for report preparation, participant consultation, and evidence gathering. Submit 4-6 weeks before plan end date.

### 6. Inflating Progress

**Mistake**: Overstating achievements to appear successful.

**Better**: Report honestly. Accurate documentation of challenges actually helps secure appropriate future funding and demonstrates professional integrity.

### 7. Failing to Make Clear Recommendations

**Mistake**: "Further supports may be beneficial."

**Better**: "Recommend increasing community participation funding from $8,000 to $12,000 to support Sarah's goal of part-time employment, specifically to fund employment exploration activities and supported work experience opportunities."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often do I need to submit support coordinator progress reports?

At minimum, support coordinators should submit three formal reports per plan: an 8-week implementation report, a mid-term review (for 12+ month plans), and an end-of-plan report 4-6 weeks before plan expiry. Additional reports may be required if there are significant changes in participant circumstances or if requested by the NDIA.

### Can I use my own template for NDIS progress reports?

Yes, you can use your own template as long as it includes all required elements: participant details, implementation status, goal progress with evidence, challenges encountered, and recommendations. However, using a template aligned with PACE system requirements ensures your reports are processed efficiently and contain the information NDIA planners need.

### What if the participant does not want certain information shared?

Participants have the right to privacy. Discuss report contents with participants before submission and respect their wishes about sensitive information. You can note in the report that certain details have been withheld at the participant's request. However, ensure participants understand that withholding relevant information may affect funding decisions.

### What is the difference between a progress report and an end of plan report?

Progress reports (8-week and mid-term) focus on implementation status and emerging outcomes during the plan period. End-of-plan reports are comprehensive summaries of the entire plan period, including complete goal assessments, full evidence documentation, and detailed recommendations for the next NDIS plan. End-of-plan reports are the most influential documents for plan review outcomes.

### How do I submit reports through the PACE system?

Log into the myNDIS provider portal, navigate to the participant's record, and use the document upload function. Select the appropriate document type (progress report, review report, etc.), upload your PDF or Word document, and submit. You will receive an automatic confirmation. Keep a copy for your records.

### What should I do if the participant has regressed rather than progressed?

Report honestly. Document what has happened, the reasons for regression (health issues, service gaps, life circumstances), actions taken to address the situation, and recommendations for supports that would help. Regression due to circumstances beyond control does not reflect negatively on service quality - it demonstrates the participant's ongoing support needs.

### How long should a support coordinator progress report be?

Length depends on complexity. A simple 8-week report for a participant with few services might be 2-3 pages. A comprehensive end-of-plan report for a participant with complex needs, multiple providers, and specialist coordination could be 10-15 pages. Focus on quality and completeness rather than length - include all relevant information without unnecessary padding.
