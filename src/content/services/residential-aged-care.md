## Still Exploring Options? Consider In-Home Care First

Before committing to residential care, it's worth exploring whether staying at home with the right support is possible. Many families are surprised by what can be achieved with a comprehensive Home Care Package.

Through MD Home Care, you can find providers offering:
*   **24/7 In-Home Nursing Care** for complex medical needs
*   **Daily Personal Care** assistance with showering, dressing, and mobility
*   **Domestic Assistance** for cleaning, cooking, and home management
*   **Respite Care** to give family carers a break

For some, a combination of these services can delay or even prevent the need to move into a facility, while staying in the comfort of home.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How much do aged care support services cost?**
The initial consultation is free. Ongoing support services vary depending on the level of assistance you need. Many families use their Home Care Package funds to cover navigation services. There are also private-pay options with transparent, hourly pricing.

**How is residential aged care funded?**
Residential aged care is funded through a combination of government subsidies and resident contributions. The amount you pay depends on a means assessment of your income and assets. Aged care specialists through MD Home Care help you understand exactly what you'll pay before you commit.

**What is an ACAT assessment?**
An Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) assessment determines your eligibility for government-subsidised aged care. Aged care specialists through MD Home Care help you prepare for this assessment and ensure your care needs are accurately captured.

That's a great outcome! If the assessment finds that in-home care is a viable option, MD Home Care can connect you with home care providers seamlessly. There's no pressure to choose residential care.
