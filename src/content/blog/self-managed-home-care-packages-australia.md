The way Australia delivers aged care is about to change significantly. As of **July 1, 2025**, the new **Support at Home** program officially replaces the old Home Care Packages (HCP) system. For Australians wanting control over their care, understanding self-management in this new world is more important than ever.

Self-managing your government-funded aged care allows you to choose your own support workers and get more care hours from your budget by reducing high provider fees. This guide explains how the new system works, compares the best self-managed aged care providers for 2025, and shows you how to take control of your care.

## Support at Home 2025: What's Changing?

The Support at Home program is designed to be more flexible and streamlined. While the core benefit of self-management remains—more choice and lower fees—the structure is different.

-   **End of Home Care Packages:** The four levels of HCP are gone. Instead, you will have a single, flexible budget based on your assessed needs.
-   **Capped Fees:** Care and package management fees are now capped. This is a major win for consumers, but it's crucial to choose a provider with a transparent and low-fee structure.
-   **Keep Unspent Funds:** You will be able to keep unspent funds, giving you more control over how your budget is used over time.

The good news? The principle of self-management is stronger than ever. You can still choose your own workers and direct your own care, but you must partner with a low-fee approved provider to administer your funds.

## Why Choose Self-Managed Aged Care?

The primary motivation for self-managing is simple: **getting more care from your government funding.**

-   **Lower Admin Fees:** Traditional providers can charge up to 30-40% of your budget in fees. Self-management providers charge significantly less, often between 13-20%.
-   **More Care Hours:** Lower fees mean more money in your budget for direct support—whether that's for personal care, cleaning, transport, or allied health.
-   **Total Control:** You choose who supports you, when they come, and what services they provide. You are not locked into a single agency's staff or schedule.

## Best Self-Managed Aged Care Providers in Australia

Choosing the right provider to partner with is the most important decision you'll make. A good provider acts as your administrative partner, handling the government funds efficiently while you manage your care.
