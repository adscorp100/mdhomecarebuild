## What is a Companion Card?

> **Check Your Eligibility:** Use our free [Companion Card Checker](/tools/companion-card-checker) to quickly assess your eligibility and find participating venues in NSW.

A Companion Card is a nationally recognised card that allows people with significant and permanent disabilities to bring a companion or carer to venues and events **free of charge**. Instead of paying for two tickets, you pay for one—your companion gets in free.

The program recognises that some people with disability require attendant care support to participate in community activities, and that the cost of a second ticket shouldn't be a barrier to participation. Over **4,200 businesses and organisations** across Australia accept the Companion Card, including cinemas, sporting venues, theatres, museums, zoos, and public transport services.

Whether you want to catch a movie, attend a concert, watch the footy, visit a museum, or take public transport, your Companion Card ensures your essential support person can accompany you without the added expense.

## Who is Eligible for a Companion Card?

To be eligible for a Companion Card in any Australian state or territory, you must meet the following criteria:

### Core Eligibility Requirements

1. **Australian Residency**: You must be a permanent Australian citizen or resident
2. **Significant and Permanent Disability**: You must have a significant disability that is permanent (lifelong)
3. **High Level of Support Needs**: Your disability must require a high level of ongoing attendant care support to participate in community activities
4. **Lifelong Need**: The need for attendant care support must be lifelong—not temporary or related to a condition that may improve

### Important Clarifications

**NDIS eligibility does not guarantee Companion Card eligibility.** While there's overlap, the Companion Card has its own assessment criteria focused specifically on your need for attendant care support at community venues and events.

**The program is not income-tested.** Your eligibility is based purely on your support needs, not your financial situation.

**Age requirements vary by state.** Most states allow applications from any age, but some have specific requirements for children.

### Types of Support That May Qualify You

You may be eligible if you need a companion to assist with:
- **Mobility support**: Help moving around venues, navigating crowds, or using transport
- **Personal care**: Assistance with toileting, eating, or medication during outings
- **Communication support**: Help communicating with staff or understanding information
- **Behavioural support**: Support managing anxiety, sensory overload, or challenging situations
- **Safety and supervision**: Constant supervision due to cognitive impairment or safety risks

Renewal is a simpler process than the initial application and typically doesn't require a new health professional assessment unless your circumstances have significantly changed.

## Where Can You Use Your Companion Card?

The Companion Card is accepted at over 4,200 venues and businesses across Australia, including:

### Entertainment & Leisure
- Cinemas (Hoyts, Event, Village, and independent cinemas)
- Theatres and performing arts centres
- Concert venues
- Museums and art galleries
- Zoos and wildlife parks
- Theme parks and attractions
- Sporting venues (AFL, NRL, cricket, etc.)
- Bowling alleys and entertainment centres

### Public Transport
- Buses
- Trains
- Ferries
- Light rail
- Some taxi services

### Tourism & Recreation
- National parks
- Tourist attractions
- Swimming pools and aquatic centres
- Fitness centres (some locations)
- Botanical gardens

### How to Identify Participating Venues

Look for the **Companion Card logo** displayed at ticket offices, entry points, or on venue websites. You can also:
- Search the online database on your state's Companion Card website
- Call the venue directly to confirm they accept the card
- Check the venue's accessibility information online

### Using Your Card Interstate

Your Companion Card is recognised **nationally**. If you're travelling to another state, your card will be accepted at participating venues in that state. This mutual recognition agreement means you only need one card, regardless of where you travel in Australia.

## Tips for a Successful Application

### 1. Be Detailed About Your Support Needs

Don't undersell your needs. The application requires you to demonstrate that you need attendant care support at **most** community activities. Be specific about:
- What tasks your companion helps you with
- Why you cannot participate without support
- Examples of situations where support is essential

### 2. Choose the Right Health Professional

Select someone who:
- Knows your condition well
- Can speak to your daily support needs
- Is willing to provide detailed information
- Has recent knowledge of your circumstances

### 3. Gather Strong Supporting Documentation

Include recent reports that specifically mention your need for ongoing support. Functional Capacity Assessments are particularly useful.

### 4. Don't Assume NDIS Means Automatic Approval

The Companion Card has different criteria than the NDIS. Your application must demonstrate your specific need for attendant care support at community venues.

### 5. Apply Before You Need It

Processing can take up to 12 weeks. Apply well before any events or activities you're planning to attend.

## What If Your Application is Declined?

If your application is unsuccessful, you typically have the right to:

1. **Request a review** of the decision
2. **Provide additional information** or documentation
3. **Appeal through your state's administrative processes**

Common reasons for declined applications include:
- Insufficient evidence of lifelong support needs
- Condition not considered permanent
- Support needs not demonstrated for community participation specifically
- Incomplete application or missing documentation

If declined, consider gathering additional evidence from health professionals and reapplying.

## Companion Card vs NDIS: What's the Difference?

| Aspect | Companion Card | NDIS |
|--------|---------------|------|
| **Purpose** | Free entry for companions at venues | Funding for disability supports and services |
| **Eligibility** | Based on need for attendant care at community venues | Based on permanent and significant disability affecting daily life |
| **Benefits** | Free companion entry at participating venues | Funding for support workers, therapy, equipment, etc. |
| **Cost** | Free to apply and use | Funded supports; may have plan-managed or self-managed costs |
| **Coverage** | Venue entry and transport | Wide range of disability-related supports |

**You can have both!** Many NDIS participants also hold a Companion Card. They serve different purposes and having one doesn't affect your eligibility for the other.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I choose anyone to be my companion?

Yes! Your companion can be anyone—a family member, friend, paid support worker, or carer. The card doesn't restrict who accompanies you, only that you need someone to accompany you.

### Do I need to bring my companion to apply?

No. The application assesses your need for a companion, not a specific person. You apply individually.

### Can I use my card for multiple companions?

The card covers one companion per outing. However, the companion can be different each time—it's not linked to a specific person.

### Is there a cost to apply?

No. The Companion Card is free to apply for and free to use.

### Can children apply for a Companion Card?

Yes, in most states. Parents or guardians complete the application on behalf of children with significant disabilities requiring attendant care support.

### What if I move interstate?

You'll need to apply for a new card in your new state of residence. However, your existing card remains valid at participating venues nationally until you receive your new card.

### Can I use my card overseas?

The Companion Card is an Australian program and is not recognised overseas. However, many international venues have their own accessibility programs—check with specific venues when travelling.
