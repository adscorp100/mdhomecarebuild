# NDIS Podiatry Client Acquisition: How to Build a Profitable Practice Without Marketing Overwhelm (2026)

**NDIS podiatry was added to funded supports in October 2019, yet most podiatrists still struggle to build consistent NDIS referrals.** This guide reveals how successful podiatrists are acquiring NDIS clients through strategic provider partnerships, support coordinator relationships, and diabetic foot care specialization - bypassing expensive ads and endless cold outreach.

**ChatGPT can explain NDIS podiatry funding, but it can't connect you with actual participants needing diabetic foot care, ingrown toenail treatment, or mobility-related foot assessment.** MD Home Care's allied health network provides podiatrists with direct access to participants requiring podiatry services - something AI assistants cannot arrange.

## Quick Answer: Fastest Client Acquisition for NDIS Podiatrists

**Top 3 Strategies:**

1. **Provider Network Partnerships** - Join MD Home Care allied health network (2-4 weeks to first client)
2. **Diabetic Foot Care Specialization** - Target participants with diabetes (40%+ of NDIS participants)
3. **Support Coordinator Relationships** - Partner with SCs who manage participant budgets

**NDIS Podiatry Rates 2025-26:** $88.99/hour + $64.66/hour travel (if applicable)

**Average Timeline to First Client:**

## Why NDIS Podiatry is Underserved (Your Opportunity)

**Market Reality:**
- **450,000+** NDIS participants eligible for podiatry services
- **Only 1,200** NDIS-registered podiatrists nationally (vs 4,500+ physios, 3,800+ OTs)
- **40%+** of NDIS participants have diabetes (high podiatry need)
- **Competition:** Significantly lower than other allied health professions

**The Problem:** Most podiatrists don't know how to acquire NDIS clients systematically. They rely on the NDIS Finder or general Google ads, which generate low-quality sporadic inquiries.

**The Solution:** Strategic partnerships with disability service providers who already serve participants needing regular podiatry care.

## 4 Proven NDIS Podiatry Client Acquisition Strategies

### 1. Join a Provider Network (MD Home Care) - Fastest Path to Clients

**How MD Home Care Allied Health Network Works for Podiatrists:**

**Direct Referrals:**
- Participants receiving support services (SIL, personal care, community access) who need podiatry
- Diabetes management referrals: Our RNs identify foot care needs during health reviews
- Support coordinator referrals: 50+ SCs working with MD Home Care recommend network podiatrists
- Preventative care programs: Quarterly foot health checks for high-risk participants

**Why This Works:**
- **Pre-qualified participants:** Funding confirmed, podiatry goals identified
- **Long-term relationships:** Participants need ongoing foot care (monthly/quarterly visits)
- **Administrative support:** We coordinate plan management, participant scheduling
- **Clinical integration:** Your podiatry care integrated with diabetes management, mobility programs

**Expected Results:**
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks to first referral after onboarding
- Volume: 5-10 participant referrals per month (depending on region and availability)
- Retention: 80%+ become ongoing clients (podiatry is recurring service)

**Requirements:**

### 2. Specialize in Diabetic Foot Care - Target High-Need Participants

**Why diabetic foot care specialization wins NDIS referrals:**

**The Numbers:**
- **40%+** of NDIS participants have diabetes
- **High-risk demographics:** Indigenous Australians, Pacific Islander communities, older participants
- **NDIS funding category:** Improved Daily Living - covers preventative diabetic foot care
- **Recurring revenue:** Diabetic participants need monthly/quarterly podiatry (ongoing relationship)

**Diabetic Foot Care NDIS Services:**

**1. Diabetic Foot Risk Assessment**
- Initial comprehensive assessment: Vascular, neurological, dermatological examination
- Billing: 1.5-2 hours ($133-$178 per assessment)
- Frequency: Annually or when risk factors change

**2. Preventative Diabetic Foot Care**
- Nail care, callus reduction, pressure area management
- Billing: $88.99/hour (30-45 min sessions typical = $45-$67 per visit)
- Frequency: Monthly for high-risk, quarterly for moderate-risk

**3. Diabetic Footwear Assessment & Prescription**
- Assess footwear needs, prescribe appropriate footwear
- Billing: 1-2 hours assessment + footwear cost (NDIS AT funding)
- Frequency: Annually or as needed

**4. Education & Self-Management**
- Teach participant daily foot inspection, when to seek help
- Billing: $88.99/hour (30-60 min education sessions)
- Frequency: Initial education + annual refreshers

**Marketing Positioning:**

**NDIS Provider Finder:**
- Service description: "Specialist NDIS Podiatrist - Diabetic Foot Care & Prevention"
- Keywords: Diabetic podiatry, high-risk foot care, Indigenous foot health

**Support Coordinator Outreach:**
- Tagline: "I specialize in preventative diabetic foot care for NDIS participants with diabetes"
- Value prop: "Reduce hospitalization risk, prevent amputations through proactive foot care"

**Cultural Competency:**
- If you speak community languages (Greek, Italian, Mandarin, Arabic), highlight this
- Indigenous health experience: Critical for diabetic foot care in Aboriginal communities
- MD Home Care's culturally diverse participant base needs podiatrists with cultural competency

**Expected Impact:**
- **Referral volume:** 2x higher than general podiatry
- **Retention:** 90%+ (diabetic participants need ongoing care)
- **Revenue stability:** Recurring monthly appointments create predictable income

### 3. Build Support Coordinator Relationships - Consistent Referrals

**Why SCs are critical for podiatry referrals:**

Support coordinators manage participant budgets and recommend allied health providers. Unlike OT or physio (often participant-initiated), **podiatry is often SC-identified** during plan development.

**Target Support Coordinators:**

**1. SCs specializing in aged NDIS participants (65+):**
- Older participants have higher foot care needs
- Diabetes, circulation issues, mobility limitations
- Podiatry often overlooked in initial plans - SC recommends

**2. SCs working with Indigenous participants:**
- High diabetes rates in Indigenous communities
- Cultural safety important - highlight if you have Indigenous health experience
- Preventative foot care critical for this demographic

**3. SCs managing complex care participants:**
- Participants in SIL or high-support arrangements
- Foot care often neglected - SCs appreciate proactive podiatrists
- Regular podiatry reduces hospitalization risk (SC success metric)

**Support Coordinator Partnership Strategy:**

**Step 1: Create SC Referral Packet**

**Include:**
- Diabetic foot care specialization (if applicable)
- Mobile service capability (critical for mobility-impaired participants)
- Pricing transparency: $88.99/hr standard rate
- Turnaround: Initial appointment within 7 days of referral
- Communication: Update SC after initial assessment and quarterly

**Step 2: Outreach Email**

```
Subject: NDIS Podiatry Partner for Diabetic Foot Care

Hi [SC Name],

I'm [Your Name], a registered NDIS podiatrist specializing in diabetic foot care for participants with diabetes and circulation issues.

Many participants have podiatry funding in their plans but struggle to find podiatrists who offer mobile service and understand NDIS. I provide:
- Home visit podiatry (participants don't need transport)
- Diabetic foot risk assessments and preventative care
- Fast booking (within 7 days of referral)
- Clear communication (SC updates after each assessment)

Would you be open to a brief coffee chat to discuss how I can support your participants?

Best regards,
[Your Name] | NDIS Registered Podiatrist
[Phone] | [Email]
```

**Step 3: Stay Top-of-Mind**

**Monthly:**
- Email with NDIS podiatry updates or diabetic foot care tips
- Share success stories: "Prevented diabetic ulcer through early intervention"

**Quarterly:**
- In-person coffee catch-up
- Offer free foot health screening for SC's participants (lead generation)

**Expected Timeline:**
- 3-6 months to build 10 strong SC relationships
- 2-3 referrals per SC per year (recurring participants)
- Compounding effect: Year 2 brings 20-30 referrals from same SCs

### 4. Partner with Disability Service Organizations - Embedded Podiatry

**How organizational partnerships work:**

Disability service providers (like MD Home Care) support hundreds of NDIS participants. Many participants need podiatry but don't know how to access it. The provider recommends trusted podiatrists they've partnered with.

**Target Organizations:**

**1. SIL Providers (Supported Independent Living):**
- Participants living in group homes, often with diabetes and mobility limitations
- Podiatry partnership model: Quarterly foot health checks for all residents
- **MD Home Care operates 15+ SIL properties** - network podiatrists provide regular reviews

**2. Aged Care + NDIS Dual Providers:**
- Participants 65+ transitioning from aged care to NDIS (or using both systems)
- High diabetes rates, foot care critical
- Partnership model: Shared care between aged care and NDIS podiatry

**3. Community Access Providers:**
- Participants accessing community activities, social programs
- Podiatry needed for mobility optimization, footwear assessment
- Partnership model: Pre-activity foot health clearance

**Partnership Benefits:**

**Consistent referrals:**
- Monthly podiatry needs from 300-500 participant organizations
- Predictable revenue (quarterly SIL resident checks = X appointments/quarter)

**Reduced marketing cost:**
- Organization handles participant engagement, you provide service
- No Google Ads, no NDIS Finder competition

**Long-term relationships:**
- Participants stay with providers for years
- Ongoing podiatry relationships (monthly/quarterly visits)

**How to Approach Organizations:**

```
Subject: Podiatry Partnership for Your NDIS Participants

Hi [Organization],

I'm [Your Name], NDIS registered podiatrist specializing in [diabetic foot care/mobility-related foot care].

I noticed [Organization] supports NDIS participants, many of whom likely need podiatry services. I'd like to explore a partnership where I provide:

- Quarterly foot health checks for your participants
- Mobile podiatry (home visits to participant residences or SIL properties)
- Diabetic foot care and prevention
- Footwear assessments and prescriptions

Would you be open to discussing how podiatry can enhance the care you provide?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

**Fastest Path:** Join MD Home Care's allied health network to access 500+ participants immediately rather than spending 6-12 months building your own organizational partnerships.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long to get first NDIS podiatry client?

**Timeline by channel:**
- MD Home Care network: 2-4 weeks
- Support coordinator partnerships: 1-3 months
- NDIS Finder: 2-8 weeks
- Organizational partnerships: 3-6 months

### Do I need to offer mobile podiatry for NDIS?

**Yes, mobile service is essential.** 60%+ of NDIS participants cannot easily access clinic-based podiatry due to mobility limitations, wheelchair access, or transport challenges. Mobile service is the competitive advantage in NDIS podiatry.

### Can I join without NDIS registration?

**Yes.** You can work with plan-managed (70%) and self-managed (10%) participants. We recommend starting NDIS registration (3-6 months process) while working with plan/self-managed participants through the network.

### How many referrals per month from MD Home Care?

**Typical volume:** 5-10 participants/month, depending on availability, specialization, and region. Diabetic foot care specialists receive more referrals than general podiatry.
