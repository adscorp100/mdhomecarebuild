# Support to Live Independently, With the Dignity You Deserve.

Needing help with daily personal tasks is a sensitive subject. It's difficult to ask for, and even harder to find a provider you can truly trust. The fear of losing your independence, privacy, or sense of self is real.

We understand. At MD Home Care, our Personal Care service is built on one core principle: **your dignity comes first.** Our role is not to take over, but to provide discreet, respectful support that empowers you to live your life the way you want to, in the comfort of your own home.

## The Right Support is About More Than Just Tasks

You're not just looking for a caregiver; you're looking for a partner in your wellbeing. Someone who is not only skilled, but also compassionate, respectful, and reliable.

Are you worried about:
*   **A stranger in your home?** We ensure you are comfortable and feel safe with the person we provide.
*   **Losing your routine?** We adapt to your schedule and your way of doing things, not the other way around.
*   **Inconsistent care?** We strive to provide a consistent caregiver you can build a trusting relationship with.
*   **Your privacy?** Our team is rigorously trained in professional conduct and respecting your personal space and privacy.

We're here to solve these worries, providing a service that feels less like a service and more like a helping hand from a trusted friend.

## Our Commitment to Your Dignity: How We Can Help

Our support is always person-centered and provided with the utmost respect.

*   **Personal Hygiene & Grooming:** Assistance with showering, bathing, dressing, and grooming to help you feel your best.
*   **Continence Management:** Discreet and professional support with toileting and continence aids.
*   **Mobility & Transfers:** Safe assistance with moving around the home, getting in and out of bed, or transferring to a chair.
*   **Medication Reminders:** Gentle reminders to ensure medications are taken correctly and on schedule.
*   **Wound Care & Health Support:** Basic wound dressing and health monitoring, in coordination with your other healthcare providers.

## Why MD Home Care is a Partner You Can Trust

Inviting someone to help with personal care requires the highest level of trust. We earn it through our people and our promises.

### Our Caregivers: Vetted, Trained & Compassionate
We don't use contractors. Our caregivers are part of the MD Home Care family, chosen for their empathy as much as their skills.
*   **Rigorous Screening:** Every caregiver passes an NDIS Worker Screening Check, a police check, and multiple reference checks.
*   **Specialised Training:** Our team receives ongoing training in manual handling, infection control, privacy, and providing person-centered care for conditions like dementia.
*   **The Right Match:** We take the time to understand you and match you with a caregiver whose personality and skills are the right fit.

### The Promise of Coordinated, Reliable Care
*   **A Consistent Face:** Our goal is to provide a consistent primary caregiver to foster a strong, trusting relationship.
*   **Team-Based Approach:** If your regular caregiver is sick, a fully-briefed backup from our trusted team is available, ensuring you're never without support.
*   **We Work With Your Doctor:** We can coordinate with your GP, specialists, or Allied Health professionals to ensure your care is seamless.

## Making Funding Simple
We are experts in navigating government funding for personal care.

*   **Home Care Packages (HCP):** Personal care is a core service available under all package levels. We help you budget and manage your funds effectively.
*   **NDIS Plans:** This support falls under **Core Supports - Assistance with Daily Life**. We work with you and your plan manager to ensure you get the support you're approved for.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What happens if I'm not comfortable with my caregiver?**
Your comfort is our absolute priority. If for any reason you do not feel the match is right, you can contact your Care Manager at any time. We will listen without judgment and work to find a caregiver you feel completely comfortable and safe with.

**How do you protect my privacy and dignity?**
This is the foundation of our training. Every caregiver is trained on the Aged Care Code of Conduct and NDIS Code of Conduct, which have strict standards for privacy, dignity, and respect. We reinforce this in our regular team meetings and reviews.

**Do I get a say in my care routine?**
Absolutely. It's *your* routine. We are there to support you, not to dictate how you live. Your care plan is designed with you, and our caregivers are trained to adapt to your preferences.
