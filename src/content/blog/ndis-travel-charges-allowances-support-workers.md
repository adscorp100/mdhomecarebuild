### How many km can NDIS providers charge for travel?

There is no strict maximum kilometer limit for NDIS travel claims. However, travel must be reasonable and necessary for service delivery.

Travel between participants is claimable when delivering services.

Yes, providers can charge both travel time and kilometer costs, but they cover different expenses:
- **Kilometer rates** ($0.99/km standard, $2.76/km modified vehicle) cover vehicle operating costs
- **Travel time** is charged at the same hourly rate as the support being delivered and compensates the worker for their time

Travel time is subject to caps: 30 minutes in metropolitan areas, 60 minutes in regional areas, and 90 minutes in remote areas per journey between participants.
