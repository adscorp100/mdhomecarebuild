## Understanding NDIS Codes and Line Items

The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) uses a comprehensive system of codes and line items to categorize and track support funding. This guide provides detailed information about NDIS service codes, pricing, and claiming rules for 2024-25, helping participants and providers navigate the system effectively.

### What are NDIS Support Codes?

NDIS support codes (also known as line items or item codes) are unique identifiers used to classify and claim different types of disability supports. Each code consists of:
- A numerical identifier (e.g., 01_002_0107_1_1)
- A support category designation
- A clear description of the service
- Associated pricing and claiming rules

### Understanding the NDIS Price Guide and Support Codes

The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) provides funding for a wide range of supports and services. Understanding how these are categorized, coded, and priced is crucial for participants, their families, carers, support coordinators, and providers. This guide serves as a practical, quick reference for specific NDIS line items requested by users, based on the 2024-25 NDIS framework. It aims to demystify these codes and provide clarity on associated pricing and rules.

### What is an NDIS Line Item?

Every support or service funded by the NDIS is assigned a unique **NDIS Line Item**. This consists of two parts: a brief description of the support delivered and a unique numerical code. These line items act as specific identifiers, allowing the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) to track spending against a participant's plan budget and ensuring providers invoice correctly for the services provided.

The numerical code itself has an underlying structure, typically following a pattern like: `Support Category_Sequence Number_Registration Group_Outcome Domain_Support Purpose`. While this structure provides some logic (e.g., the first two digits often indicate the broad Support Category), the sequence numbers can be used inconsistently by the NDIA, so it's generally not advisable to rely solely on the number structure to determine the exact nature of the support. The official name and description associated with the code are the reliable identifiers.

### Why Understanding Line Items Matters

A clear understanding of NDIS line items benefits everyone involved. For participants, it helps in tracking their budget usage, ensuring the services they receive align with their plan funding, and verifying provider invoices. For providers, using the correct line item is essential for accurate claiming, compliance with NDIS rules, and avoiding payment delays or rejections.

### The Official Sources: PAPL and Support Catalogue

The definitive information regarding NDIS pricing and supports comes from two key official documents published by the NDIA:

1. **NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits (PAPL):** This document acts as the 'rulebook'. It outlines the pricing framework, rules, and conditions under which supports can be claimed, including details on travel, cancellations, and non-face-to-face support.
2. **NDIS Support Catalogue:** This document functions as the 'price list' or database. It lists all available support items with their codes, official names, descriptions, and the **maximum price limits** providers can charge.

It is crucial to consult **both** documents for a complete understanding. The Support Catalogue provides the price, but the PAPL explains the rules governing _when_ and _how_ that price can be applied, including any additional charges permitted (like travel) or specific conditions (like cancellation policies). Relying solely on the price list without understanding the associated rules in the PAPL can lead to errors in claiming or budgeting.

These documents are typically updated annually around July 1st, but amendments can occur throughout the year. Therefore, always check the NDIS website for the most current versions before making decisions. The latest versions relevant to this guide are effective from **October 1, 2024**.

Additionally, supplementary documents called **Addenda** may be released for specific circumstances, such as bereavement or temporary measures like those related to COVID-19. These must be read in conjunction with the main PAPL document.

## Section 2: NDIS Support Categories and Item Codes

### NDIS Budget Types and Service Codes

Before diving into the specific line items, it's helpful to understand the broader context of NDIS budgets and pricing rules.

### NDIS Budget Types

NDIS plans typically organize funding into three main budget types:

1. **Core Supports:** Funds supports related to everyday activities, daily living needs, community participation, consumables, and transport. This budget is generally the most flexible.
2. **Capital Supports:** Funds investments like assistive technology (AT), equipment, home or vehicle modifications, and Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). This budget is generally not flexible.
3. **Capacity Building Supports:** Funds supports aimed at building independence and skills, such as therapy, support coordination, finding employment, or improving relationships. Funding is generally not flexible _between_ different capacity building categories.

### Budget Flexibility Explained

Flexibility refers to the ability to use funding allocated for one support category or item on another.

* **Core Budget Flexibility:** The Core budget offers the most flexibility. In most cases, funds can be moved between the different Core support categories (Assistance with Daily Life, Consumables, Assistance with Social & Community Participation). Transport funding within Core often has specific rules and may be less flexible.
* **Limited Flexibility Across Budget Types:** Crucially, funding generally **cannot** be moved between the three main budget types (Core, Capital, Capacity Building). Core funds must be used for Core supports, Capital for Capital, and Capacity Building for Capacity Building.
* **Stated Supports:** Some funding within any budget type might be designated as 'Stated Support' (or 'stated item'). This means the funds are specifically allocated for a particular item or service (e.g., Plan Management fees, a specific piece of Assistive Technology) and **cannot** be used for anything else without NDIA approval. This significantly reduces flexibility, even within the Core budget. Participants must check their plan document to identify any stated supports. Changing a stated support typically requires a plan variation or review.

### Plan Management Types & Impact

How a participant chooses to manage their NDIS funding impacts provider choice and pricing adherence:

1. **Self-Managed:** The participant (or nominee) directly manages the funds, pays providers, and claims reimbursement. This offers maximum flexibility: participants can use **registered or unregistered providers** and can **negotiate prices**, potentially paying above the NDIS price limits if they choose.
2. **Plan-Managed:** A registered Plan Manager manages the funds, pays provider invoices, and handles claims. Participants gain support with financial administration while retaining flexibility in provider choice: they can use **registered or unregistered providers**, but providers **must adhere to NDIS price limits**. Funding for plan management is typically a stated support in the Capacity Building budget.
3. **Agency-Managed (NDIA-Managed):** The NDIA manages the funds and pays providers directly. This option involves the least administration for the participant but offers the least flexibility: participants **must use NDIS registered providers**, and providers **must adhere to NDIS price limits**.

Understanding the interplay between budget type, stated supports, and plan management type is essential. For instance, having flexible Core funding for 'Assistance with Daily Life' means different things depending on management type. A self-managed participant could potentially pay a preferred, unregistered support worker a rate above the NDIS limit, while a plan-managed participant using the same worker would be restricted to the NDIS price limit. This multi-layered check (Budget Type -> Stated Item? -> Management Type) is vital for practical decision-making.

### Pricing Variations

Several factors influence the maximum price limit for a support item:

* **Maximum Limits:** Price limits in the Support Catalogue are maximums for Agency- and Plan-Managed participants. Negotiation for lower prices is always possible and encouraged. Self-managed participants are not bound by these limits.
* **Location (Modified Monash Model - MMM):** The NDIS uses the MMM system to classify geographical areas based on remoteness. Higher price limits apply to account for increased service delivery costs in remote areas:
  * **MMM 1-5 (Metropolitan, Regional Centres, Regional Areas):** Standard National price limits apply.
  * **MMM 6 (Remote):** Price limits are generally 40% higher than National rates.
  * **MMM 7 (Very Remote):** Price limits are generally 50% higher than National rates.
  * Participants and providers can check a location's MMM classification using the [Health Workforce Locator tool](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/health-workforce-locator/health-workforce-locator) (ensure the '2019' MMM box is ticked as per NDIS guidelines).
* **Time of Day/Week:** For supports delivered by disability support workers (primarily in Core and some Capacity Building categories), different price limits apply depending on the time and day the support is provided (e.g., Weekday Daytime, Weekday Evening, Weekday Night, Saturday, Sunday, Public Holiday).
* **Intensity:** Some supports have higher price limits for 'High Intensity' delivery, applicable when participants require frequent assistance with complex behaviours or need support workers with specific high-intensity skills.

The application of higher price limits in remote areas acknowledges the genuine increased costs of operating in these regions. However, if budget allocations are not proportionally increased for remote participants, this can lead to challenges where the same nominal funding amount buys fewer hours of support compared to metropolitan areas, potentially impacting service access equity. The complexity of varying rates also demands careful attention to detail during invoicing and budget tracking.

## Section 4: NDIS Line Items - Complete Support Codes List

### 01 – NDIS Assistance with Daily Life Codes

**Category Definition & Support Codes:** This Core Supports category funds assistance or supervision for personal tasks in day-to-day life, enabling participants to live as independently as possible. Supports can be provided individually in various environments, including the participant's home. It covers a wide range, from basic personal care to more complex arrangements like Supported Independent Living (SIL) and Short Term Accommodation (STA)/Respite. Many items in this category have price variations based on time of day, day of week, and support intensity, reflecting the 24/7 nature of these needs and alignment with support worker award conditions. High-cost items like SIL and STA often require quotes.

### 10 – Transport

**Category Definition:** This Core Supports category helps participants pay for transport needed to achieve their plan goals, such as travelling to work, appointments, or community activities. Funding is often provided as a periodic payment directly to the participant (Recurring Transport) or can be used to pay providers for transport services.

## Section 5: Important Rules & Conditions Explained

The 'Key Conditions' column in the tables flags common rules that affect how line items can be used and claimed. Understanding these is essential for correct NDIS plan utilisation.

### Quote Required

* **What it means:** For certain supports, especially those that are high-cost, complex, or highly tailored, the NDIA requires a formal quote from the provider to be submitted and approved _before_ funding is allocated in the plan or before the support can be claimed.
* **When it typically applies:** Commonly required for higher-cost Assistive Technology (often over $1,500), Home Modifications, Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA), complex Supported Independent Living (SIL) arrangements, and specific items noted in the PAPL or Support Catalogue (like `01_004_0107_1_1` Assistance with Personal Domestic Activities, `04_210_0125_6_1` Community Social And Recreational Activities, `09_008_0116_6_3` Innovative Community Participation, `09_011_0125_6_3` Community Participation Activities, and `10_021_0102_5_3` SLES).
* **Practical Implications:** Participants and providers need to factor in extra time for obtaining quotes and waiting for NDIA approval. This process ensures value for money on significant investments but can delay access to the support. Clear communication and timely submission of detailed quotes are vital.

### Stated Support

* **What it means:** Funding allocated as a 'stated support' is strictly ring-fenced for that specific purpose and cannot be used flexibly for any other item, even within the same budget category. The plan will explicitly state which supports are funded this way.
* **When it typically applies:** Common examples include funding for Plan Management (`14_001_0127_8_3`), Support Coordination (`07_002_0106_8_3`), Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA), specific high-cost Assistive Technology, and sometimes SIL or other supports as determined by the planner.
* **Practical Implications:** Stated supports limit participant choice and control if their needs or preferences change during the plan period. Using these funds for something else requires a plan variation or review. Participants need to carefully review their NDIS plan document (not just the portal summary) to identify any stated supports and understand the limitations on those funds.

### Non-Face-to-Face (NF2F) Supports

* **What it means:** This refers to time spent by a provider working on tasks directly related to a specific participant's support needs, but when the participant is not physically present. Examples include writing participant-specific reports, researching tailored solutions, or preparing specialised materials for a session.
* **Rules:** Providers can claim for NF2F time only if:
  * The activity is directly linked to delivering a specific support item for that participant.
  * It is **not** part of general overheads or administrative tasks like invoicing, staff training, rostering, or standard record keeping.
  * The participant has agreed to these charges in advance, usually documented in the Service Agreement.
  * The provider explains the activity and why it represents value for money.
  * The claim is made using the same support line item as the direct service, selecting the 'Non-Face-to-Face' option in the claiming portal.
* **Practical Implications:** NF2F charges can add to the overall cost of support delivery. Clear communication and explicit agreement in the Service Agreement are essential to avoid disputes. Providers must be able to justify the time spent and link it directly to the participant's support. Participants should understand what NF2F activities they are agreeing to pay for.

### Provider Travel

* **What it means:** NDIS allows providers to claim costs associated with travelling to deliver face-to-face supports to participants. This acknowledges the time and expense involved, particularly for mobile services or in regional/remote areas.
* **Rules:**
  * **Agreement:** Travel costs must be agreed upon by the participant in advance, typically in the Service Agreement.
  * **Travel Time:** Providers can claim for the time spent travelling _to_ a participant. The maximum claimable time depends on the location's MMM zone: up to 30 minutes each way for MMM 1-3 (major cities/regional centres) and up to 60 minutes each way for MMM 4-5 (regional areas). For MMM 6-7 (remote/very remote), travel time is as agreed up to the support's hourly rate. Travel time is charged at the agreed hourly rate for the support item (or lower).
  * **Return Travel:** Travel time _from_ the last participant back to the provider's usual place of work can sometimes be claimed (under the same MMM time limits), but only if the provider is required to pay their worker for that return travel time.
  * **Multiple Participants:** If travelling to see multiple participants in one trip, the travel time and costs should be reasonably apportioned (split) among them, with prior agreement.
  * **Non-Labour Costs:** Providers can also claim for non-labour costs like road tolls, parking fees, and vehicle running costs. Vehicle running costs can be claimed up to $0.99 per km for standard vehicles or $2.76 per km for modified/accessible vehicles. These are claimed using specific 'Provider travel - non-labour costs' line items (often ending in '799') or 'Activity Based Transport' line items (often ending in '59x').
  * **Invoicing:** Travel time and non-labour costs must be claimed separately from the primary support on invoices.
* **Practical Implications:** Travel costs can significantly impact a participant's budget, especially for those living further from providers. Clear discussion and documentation in Service Agreements are vital. Participants should understand the MMM zone rules and agree on how travel time and costs will be calculated and potentially apportioned.

### Short Notice Cancellations (SNC)

* **What it means:** If a participant cancels a scheduled support appointment without providing sufficient notice, the provider may be able to charge a cancellation fee. This policy aims to compensate providers for income lost due to last-minute changes.
* **Rules (Effective July 1, 2024):** The required notice period now differs based on the type of support:
  * **Disability Support Worker (DSW) Supports:** For supports typically delivered by disability support workers (e.g., personal care, community access under Core supports), the short notice period remains **7 clear days**.
  * **Non-DSW Supports:** For supports typically delivered by therapists, plan managers, support coordinators, etc. (most Capacity Building supports), the short notice period is **2 clear business days**.
* **Other Conditions:** To claim an SNC fee (up to 100% of the agreed price for the cancelled support - check latest PAPL for exact percentage), the provider must demonstrate that:
  * The cancellation policy is stated in the Service Agreement.
  * They could not find alternative billable work for the staff member scheduled for the appointment.
  * The claim is made using the relevant support item with the 'Cancellation' option selected.
* **Practical Implications:** This dual timeline requires careful attention from both participants and providers. Participants need to be aware of the _specific_ notice period required for _each type_ of support they receive to avoid unexpected fees. Providers must ensure their Service Agreements clearly reflect the correct cancellation terms for different service types. This change was introduced partly due to rising cancellation costs, particularly for therapy services.

The complexity arising from these varied conditions highlights the critical need for transparent communication and comprehensive Service Agreements. Misunderstandings about whether a quote is needed, if funding is stated, or how travel and cancellation rules apply are common sources of confusion and potential disputes. Navigating these requires diligence from all parties.

## Section 6: Tips for Using This Guide & Finding More Help

This guide provides a snapshot of specific NDIS line items based on the 2024-25 framework. However, the NDIS is a dynamic system. Here are some tips for effectively using this information and finding further assistance:

* **Always Check Official Sources:** While this guide aims for accuracy based on information available up to October 2024, the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and the NDIS Support Catalogue on the official NDIS website ([www.ndis.gov.au](https://www.ndis.gov.au/)) are the definitive sources. Always refer to the latest versions before making final decisions.
* **Price Limits vs. Actual Costs:** Remember that the prices listed are _maximum limits_ for Agency-Managed and Plan-Managed participants. Providers cannot charge more than these limits. However, participants (especially those who are Self-Managed) and providers can negotiate lower rates.
* **Use Online Tools Cautiously:** Several third-party organisations offer helpful online NDIS price guide search tools and calculators (e.g., MyCareSpace, Plan Partners, Plan Tracker). These can be convenient starting points, but always verify the information against the official NDIS documents, as third-party tools may not always be instantly updated with the latest changes. The official NDIS website also has a Provider Finder tool to locate registered providers.
* **The Importance of Service Agreements:** A clear, written Service Agreement between the participant and provider is crucial. It should detail the specific supports to be delivered (including line items), agreed prices (especially if lower than the limit), and how conditions like travel, NF2F activities, and cancellations will be handled. This document helps prevent misunderstandings and provides a reference point if issues arise.
* **Seek Support When Needed:** Navigating NDIS line items, budgets, and rules can be complex. Don't hesitate to seek assistance. Your Support Coordinator, Plan Manager, Local Area Coordinator (LAC), or the NDIA National Contact Centre can provide clarification and guidance tailored to your specific situation and plan.

Ultimately, while this guide provides specific data points, its greater value lies in equipping users with the understanding of _how_ the system works – how prices vary, what conditions mean, and where to find definitive answers. This knowledge empowers users to navigate the NDIS more effectively, both now and as the scheme continues to evolve.
