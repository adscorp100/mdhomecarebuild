## How to Apply for NDIS in Australia: Complete 2026 Guide

**Quick Facts: Applying for NDIS**

Applying for the NDIS can feel overwhelming. Between gathering evidence, filling out forms, and understanding eligibility criteria, many people don't know where to start—or they submit incomplete applications that get rejected.

The good news? You don't have to do it alone. This guide explains exactly who can help you apply for the NDIS, what evidence you need, and how to avoid the most common mistakes that lead to rejections.

## Who Can Help You Apply for the NDIS?

Several free and paid services can assist with your NDIS application:

| Service | What They Do | Cost |
|---------|--------------|------|
| **Local Area Coordinator (LAC)** | Guides you through forms, helps gather evidence, explains the process | Free |
| **Disability Advocates** | Reviews your application, explains your rights, can attend meetings with you | Usually free |
| **Community NGOs** | One-on-one support, workshops, checklists | Free or low-cost |
| **Support Coordinators** | Helps with paperwork, gathers reports, liaises with NDIA | Sometimes free, or hourly fee |
| **Paid Application Assistants** | Does the entire application for you | $150-$600 |

### Local Area Coordinators (LACs) - Your First Stop

LACs are government-funded workers whose job is to help you through the NDIS access process. They can:

- Explain eligibility requirements
- Help you understand what evidence you need
- Assist with completing the Access Request Form
- Submit your application on your behalf
- Prepare you for your planning meeting

**How to find your LAC:**
- Call the NDIS on **1800 800 110**
- Search "Local Area Coordinator" on the NDIS website
- Ask at your local community health centre

> **Pro tip:** LACs can also help if you already have a plan and need a review, not just for first-time applicants.

### Disability Advocacy Services (Free)

Disability advocates are independent of the NDIA and can provide impartial support. They're particularly helpful if:

- You've been rejected before and want to appeal
- You feel overwhelmed by the process
- You want someone to review your application before you submit
- You need someone to attend meetings with you

### Community Organisations

Many community organisations offer NDIS application support, including:

- **Carers Australia** - Support for carers applying on behalf of family members
- **Scope Australia** - Workshops and one-on-one assistance
- **Local council disability services** - Often have access workers who can help
- **Community health centres** - May have NDIS navigators on staff

## NDIS Eligibility Criteria (2026)

Before applying, make sure you meet the basic eligibility requirements:

### Age Requirements
- You must be **under 65 years old** when you first apply
- Children under 9 may access the Early Childhood pathway
- If you're already in the NDIS and turn 65, you stay in the scheme

### Residency Requirements
You must be one of the following:
- Australian citizen
- Permanent resident
- Holder of a Protected Special Category Visa
- Living in an area where the NDIS operates

### Disability Requirements

The NDIS doesn't have a list of "approved" conditions. Instead, they assess whether your disability:

1. **Is permanent** - Expected to last your whole life or at least 12+ months
2. **Causes significant functional impact** - Substantially affects your daily life
3. **Requires support** - You need assistance to do everyday activities

### Conditions That Often Qualify

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Physical** | Cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, severe arthritis |
| **Intellectual** | Down syndrome, intellectual disability |
| **Sensory** | Blindness, deafness, significant vision/hearing impairment |
| **Cognitive/Neurological** | Autism, acquired brain injury, stroke, Parkinson's, epilepsy |
| **Psychosocial** | Schizophrenia, severe bipolar disorder, severe depression/anxiety with functional impact |

**Remember:** The NDIS looks at how your condition affects your daily life, not just the diagnosis itself. Someone with the same condition might be eligible while another person isn't, depending on their functional impact.

## Evidence You Need for Your Application

The strength of your evidence can make or break your application. Here's what to gather:

### Essential Documents

**Identity and Residency:**
- Passport, driver's licence, or birth certificate
- Proof of Australian citizenship or visa
- Current address verification

**Medical Evidence:**
- Diagnosis from a relevant specialist (not just GP)
- Reports dated within the last 12 months
- Clear statement that condition is permanent

**Functional Evidence:**
- Occupational therapy assessment
- Physiotherapy reports
- Psychology or psychiatric reports
- Speech pathology assessment (if relevant)

### What Makes Strong Evidence?

The NDIA wants to see **how your disability affects your daily life**, not just what your diagnosis is.

**Weak evidence:**
> "Patient has autism spectrum disorder, diagnosed in 2019."

**Strong evidence:**
> "Patient has autism spectrum disorder. They require 2 hours daily support for personal care including showering prompts, meal preparation, and medication management. They are unable to use public transport independently due to sensory overload and communication difficulties. They cannot maintain employment without workplace modifications and support."

### Functional Impact Checklist

When gathering evidence, make sure your reports address these areas:

| Life Area | Questions Your Evidence Should Answer |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| **Self-care** | Can you shower, dress, eat, toilet independently? How long does it take? |
| **Mobility** | Can you move around your home safely? Use public transport? Drive? |
| **Communication** | Can you communicate your needs? Use a phone? Have conversations? |
| **Social interaction** | Can you maintain relationships? Participate in community? |
| **Learning** | Can you learn new skills? Remember information? Make decisions? |
| **Employment** | Can you work? What modifications would you need? |

## How to Apply: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Check Eligibility
Use the NDIS eligibility checker at ndis.gov.au or call 1800 800 110.

### Step 2: Gather Your Evidence
Collect all medical reports, assessments, and identity documents. Aim for reports dated within the last 12 months.

### Step 3: Contact Your LAC
Call the NDIS on 1800 800 110 to be connected with your Local Area Coordinator. They'll guide you through the rest.

### Step 4: Complete the Access Request Form

You can complete this:
- **Online:** Through the NDIS portal (requires a PRODA account)
- **Paper:** Download the form and mail it in
- **With your LAC:** They can fill it out with you

**Key sections to complete:**
- Personal details and contact information
- Current living situation
- Your disability and diagnosis
- How your disability affects daily life
- Your goals (what you want to achieve)
- Supporting evidence (attach documents)

### Step 5: Submit and Wait

- The NDIA has **21 days** to make a decision
- They may request additional information (respond quickly)
- You'll receive written notification of the outcome

### Step 6: Planning Meeting (If Approved)

If your access request is approved, you'll be invited to a planning meeting to develop your NDIS plan. This usually happens within 2-4 weeks of approval.

## Common Mistakes That Get Applications Rejected

Based on real NDIA data and community feedback, these are the most common reasons applications fail:

### 1. Insufficient Functional Evidence
**The mistake:** Only providing a diagnosis letter without explaining daily impact.

**The fix:** Include detailed functional assessments from OTs, psychologists, or other allied health professionals that describe exactly how your disability affects everyday activities.

### 2. Outdated Reports
**The mistake:** Submitting medical reports from 2+ years ago.

**The fix:** Get updated assessments within the last 12 months. If you can't get new reports, ask your doctor for a letter confirming your condition hasn't changed.

### 3. Vague Goals
**The mistake:** Writing "I want to be more independent."

**The fix:** Write SMART goals:
> "I want to be able to travel to the local shopping centre independently using my wheelchair so I can do my own grocery shopping once per week."

### 4. Missing the "Permanent" Criteria
**The mistake:** Condition documentation suggests the impairment is temporary.

**The fix:** Ensure your medical reports clearly state the condition is permanent or likely to last 12+ months.

### 5. Incomplete Forms
**The mistake:** Leaving sections blank or not answering all questions.

**The fix:** Use the checklist provided with the form. Have someone review your application before submitting.

### 6. Not Following Up
**The mistake:** Submitting and waiting indefinitely without checking status.

**The fix:** Follow up with your LAC or the NDIS every 2-3 weeks. Keep a log of all communications.

## What to Do If Your Application Is Rejected

A rejection isn't the end. Many people succeed on their second attempt or through the appeals process.

### Step 1: Understand Why
Request a detailed explanation of why your application was rejected. The NDIA must tell you the specific reasons.

### Step 2: Request an Internal Review
You have **28 days** from receiving the decision to request an internal review. During this review:
- You can submit additional evidence
- The decision will be reconsidered by a different NDIA officer
- You'll receive a new decision

### Step 3: Appeal to the AAT
If the internal review is also unsuccessful, you can appeal to the **Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)** within 28 days of the internal review decision.

**Tips for AAT appeals:**
- Consider getting a disability advocate or legal aid support
- Gather all your evidence and create a clear timeline
- Prepare a written statement explaining why you meet eligibility criteria
- You may be able to get free legal representation through Legal Aid

### Appeals Success Rates
Many rejected applicants succeed on appeal. Common reasons for overturned decisions:
- Additional evidence provided
- Functional impact was clearer in the appeal
- Original assessment was incomplete
- New medical reports supported the case

## Tips for a Successful Application

### From People Who've Been Through It

Based on community forums and real experiences, here's what people wish they'd known:

**1. Start early**
> "I wish I'd started gathering evidence months before applying. Getting specialist appointments takes time."

**2. Be honest about bad days**
> "I used to put on a brave face. Don't do that. The NDIA needs to understand your worst days, not your best."

**3. Get a comprehensive functional assessment**
> "One good OT functional capacity assessment was worth more than 10 GP letters."

**4. Bring support to meetings**
> "I brought my mum to my planning meeting. Having someone who knows me well made a huge difference."

**5. Keep copies of everything**
> "I kept digital copies of every document I submitted. When they asked for clarification, I could respond same day."

**6. Don't accept the first plan if it's wrong**
> "My first plan was way under what I needed. I requested a review within 30 days and got it fixed."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I apply for someone else?

Yes. Carers, family members, or guardians can submit an application on behalf of someone with a disability. You'll need their consent (or legal authority if they lack capacity to consent) and their personal documents.

### Do I need a formal diagnosis?

A formal diagnosis helps but isn't always required. The NDIS can accept applications based on functional impact even if a formal diagnosis is still being established. However, having a diagnosis from a relevant specialist significantly strengthens your application.

### Can I apply if I'm already receiving other disability support?

Yes. Receiving Disability Support Pension (DSP), state disability services, or other support doesn't disqualify you from the NDIS. In fact, existing support documentation can be useful evidence.

### What if I'm over 65?

Unfortunately, you cannot make a first application after age 65. However, if you're already an NDIS participant and turn 65, you remain in the scheme. People over 65 may be eligible for aged care services instead.

### How much does it cost to apply?

The application itself is free. However, you may need to pay for medical assessments and reports if they're not bulk-billed. Some allied health assessments can cost $200-$500, though many participants get these through Medicare or existing healthcare providers.

### Can I reapply if I'm rejected?

Yes. There's no limit on how many times you can apply. If your circumstances change or you have new evidence, you can submit a fresh application at any time.
