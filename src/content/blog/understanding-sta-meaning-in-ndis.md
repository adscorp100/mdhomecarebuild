## **Introduction**

Navigating the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) can be complex, especially with terms like **STA (Short-Term Accommodation)** frequently appearing in support plans. If you're wondering, "What does STA mean in NDIS?" or how it benefits participants, this guide breaks down everything you need to know. We'll explain STA's role, eligibility criteria, funding, and how to access it.

### **What is STA in NDIS?**

**STA (Short-Term Accommodation)** refers to temporary housing and support for NDIS participants, designed to provide respite for caregivers or help individuals develop independence. It covers stays of up to 14 days at a time, including:

- **Accommodation** (e.g., specialist disability housing or respite centers).
- **Personal care** (help with daily tasks).
- **Skill-building activities** (e.g., cooking, social interaction).

STA is funded under the NDIS **Core Supports** budget and is distinct from long-term housing solutions.

### **How Does STA Fit into the NDIS?**

The NDIS funds STA to achieve two key goals:

- **Respite for Caregivers**: Temporary relief for families or carers.
- **Skill Development**: Helping participants build confidence and daily living skills in a new environment.

STA is not a permanent solution but a flexible support to enhance quality of life for both participants and their support networks.

### **Who is Eligible for STA?**

To qualify for STA funding, participants must:

- Have an **NDIS plan** that identifies STA as a "reasonable and necessary" support.
- Demonstrate how STA aligns with their goals (e.g., improving independence or providing respite).
- Show that STA offers value for money compared to alternatives.

**Example**: A participant may receive STA funding to attend a weekend respite program while their primary carer takes a break.

### **How to Access STA Funding**

- **Discuss STA in Planning Meetings**: Highlight its relevance to your goals during NDIS plan reviews.
- **Submit Evidence**: Provide reports from therapists or doctors explaining why STA is essential.
- **Choose Providers**: Select NDIS-registered STA providers aligned with your needs.

STA funding is typically allocated as a **fixed amount** in your plan (e.g., "$500 per day for 7 days annually").

### **STA vs. Other NDIS Accommodation Supports**

| Support Type | Purpose | Duration |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| STA | Short-term respite/skill-building | Up to 14 days |
| MTA | Transitional housing | Up to 90 days |
| SIL | Long-term housing with support | Ongoing |

### **Benefits of STA**

- **Respite Care**: Reduces caregiver burnout.
- **Social Opportunities**: Connects participants with peers.
- **Independence**: Builds daily living skills in a supportive setting.

### **Common Questions About STA (FAQ)**

**Can STA be used for holidays?**

A: No—STA must directly relate to disability needs (e.g., skill-building). However, some "community participation" funding may cover leisure activities.

**How much STA funding can I receive?**
A: Amounts vary based on individual needs. The NDIS uses a "price guide" to determine reasonable costs.

**Can I use STA funding for unregistered providers?**
A: No—STA must be delivered by NDIS-registered providers.

### **Key Takeaways**

- STA means **Short-Term Accommodation** under the NDIS, offering temporary support and respite.
- Eligibility hinges on proving STA is "reasonable and necessary" for your goals.
- Work with your planner and providers to maximize STA's benefits.

**Conclusion**
Understanding "STA meaning NDIS" empowers participants and caregivers to make informed decisions. By leveraging STA funding effectively, you can achieve short-term goals while enhancing long-term independence.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What exactly does STA cover in the NDIS?
Short-Term Accommodation (STA) in the NDIS includes several components: (1) The accommodation itself - a place to stay temporarily; (2) All personal supports needed during the stay, such as assistance with personal care, meals, and medication management; (3) Overnight support staffing; and (4) Reasonable food costs. STA does not cover transportation to and from the accommodation (which comes from Core Transport funding), specialized therapy services during the stay (funded separately under Capacity Building), recreational activities not related to your disability needs, or regular accommodation costs for family members/carers who might accompany you (though exceptions exist for children).

### How many days of STA can I get in my NDIS plan?
There's no fixed maximum number of days for STA in NDIS plans as it depends on individual circumstances and needs. However, typical allocations range from 7-28 days per year, often with funding split into shorter periods (such as weekend stays). The NDIA considers several factors when determining your allocation: your goals and how STA supports them, the level of care you require, your primary carer's needs for respite, and your history of STA usage in previous plans. If your circumstances change (such as your primary carer facing health issues), you can request a plan review to potentially increase your STA allocation.

### What's the difference between STA and respite care?
While both provide temporary relief for carers, there are important distinctions: STA is NDIS-funded accommodation with supports for participants with disability, while traditional "respite care" was the term used in pre-NDIS state-based systems. STA has a dual purpose - both carer respite and participant skill development - while traditional respite focused primarily on giving carers a break. STA is typically delivered in dedicated disability accommodation by disability support professionals, whereas respite might have been provided in various settings including family homes. Many services previously called "respite houses" now operate as STA providers under the NDIS framework.

### How much does STA cost under the NDIS?
As of 2025, the NDIS price limits for STA range from approximately $632.86 to $2,800.66 per day, depending on the support ratio (from 1:4 to 1:1) and the complexity of needs (standard to high intensity). These rates cover the 24-hour period including accommodation, food, and support staff costs. Additional charges may apply for community activities during the stay. STA is typically more expensive on weekends and public holidays due to higher support worker rates. The exact funding in your plan will be determined during your planning meeting based on your assessed needs. Some providers may charge less than the maximum price limits, so it's worth comparing options if you're self-managing or plan-managing your funding.

### Can I use STA funding to stay at a hotel or Airbnb?
No, STA funding cannot be used for standard tourist accommodation like hotels or Airbnbs. STA must be delivered by registered NDIS providers who meet specific requirements for disability support and accommodation standards. These providers have trained staff, appropriate facilities (like accessible bathrooms and emergency response systems), and policies/procedures to ensure participant safety. If you're looking for more flexible accommodation options, discuss alternatives like Innovative Community Participation funding with your planner or Support Coordinator, though this wouldn't typically include personal support staffing that comes with STA.

### What's the difference between STA and MTA in the NDIS?
Short-Term Accommodation (STA) and Medium-Term Accommodation (MTA) serve different purposes and timeframes: STA is designed for brief stays up to 14 consecutive days, primarily for respite or skills development. MTA can last up to 90 days and is intended for participants transitioning between housing arrangements (like after hospital discharge while waiting for home modifications, during a housing crisis, or while awaiting Specialist Disability Accommodation approval). STA is funded as a core support with personal assistance included, while MTA generally only covers the accommodation component with support funded separately. STA is typically delivered in purpose-built respite facilities or group homes, while MTA might be in various housing types modified for accessibility.

### How far in advance should I book STA?
Booking timeframes vary by provider and location, but as a general rule: For weekend or holiday period stays, book 2-3 months in advance due to high demand. For regular weekday stays, 3-4 weeks notice is typically sufficient. For emergency situations (such as sudden carer illness), some providers reserve capacity for urgent placements, though availability isn't guaranteed. Popular STA providers often have waiting lists, especially in regional areas where options may be limited. Working with a Support Coordinator can help identify available providers matching your needs. The NDIS recommends planning your STA usage across your plan period to ensure you can access support when most needed.
