A Functional Capacity Assessment (FCA) is one of the most important reports for your NDIS plan. It provides evidence of how your disability affects your daily life and justifies the supports you need. But what exactly happens during an FCA? What should you expect in the report? And how does it impact your funding?

This comprehensive guide covers everything about NDIS Functional Capacity Assessments in 2025: what they are, who needs one, what assessors look at, typical costs, and a detailed breakdown of what a good FCA report contains.

## Quick Reference: FCA at a Glance

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **What It Is** | Clinical evaluation of how disability affects daily function |
| **Who Conducts It** | Occupational Therapists (OTs), Physiotherapists, Psychologists |
| **Duration** | 1-3 sessions (60-90 minutes each) |
| **Cost** | $800-$1,500 (funded through Capacity Building) |
| **Report Delivery** | 2-3 weeks after final assessment session |
| **Purpose** | Evidence for NDIS funding decisions |

## What is a Functional Capacity Assessment (FCA)?

A Functional Capacity Assessment is a comprehensive clinical evaluation conducted by an Allied Health professional to measure how your disability impacts your ability to perform everyday tasks. It provides objective, evidence-based information the NDIS uses to make funding decisions.

### What FCAs Assess

FCAs evaluate your function across six core domains:

| Domain | What's Assessed |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Mobility & Transfer** | Walking, standing, wheelchair use, bed/chair/toilet transfers |
| **Self-Care** | Bathing, dressing, toileting, grooming, feeding, medication management |
| **Communication** | Understanding language, expressing needs, using communication devices |
| **Domestic Living** | Cooking, cleaning, laundry, shopping, money management |
| **Social Participation** | Attending appointments, relationships, leisure activities |
| **Cognitive Function** | Memory, attention, problem-solving, behaviour regulation |

### FCA vs Needs Assessment: What's the Difference?

| Feature | Functional Capacity Assessment | Needs Assessment |
|---------|--------------------------------|------------------|
| **Focus** | Measures actual functional ability | Determines what supports are needed |
| **Purpose** | Clinical evidence for specific supports | Sets overall plan budget |
| **Who Does It** | Allied Health professional (OT, Physio) | NDIA planner or LAC |
| **Funding** | Capacity Building budget | Not separately funded |

## Who Needs a Functional Capacity Assessment?

Not everyone needs an FCA for their NDIS plan. They're typically required for:

| Situation | Why FCA is Needed |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA)** | Proves functional need for modified housing |
| **Supported Independent Living (SIL)** | Justifies 24/7 support level |
| **Assistive Technology (over $1,500)** | Shows the functional limitation the equipment addresses |
| **Home Modifications** | Provides clinical justification for changes |
| **Complex Plan Reviews** | Updates evidence when needs change significantly |
| **NDIS Appeals** | Supplies objective evidence for internal reviews |
| **New Participants** with complex needs | Establishes baseline functional profile |

> **Tip:** If you're unsure whether you need an FCA, ask your Support Coordinator or LAC. They can advise whether existing evidence is sufficient or if an FCA would strengthen your funding request.

## Why a *Good* Report Matters for Your NDIS Funding

The NDIS uses your FCA report to make informed decisions about your plan. A high-quality report clearly justifies the need for specific supports, services, and equipment.

Here's why it's so important:
- **Provides Objective Evidence:** It translates your day-to-day experiences into a format the NDIS understands and trusts.
- **Justifies Funding Requests:** It connects your needs directly to recommended supports, making it easier for the NDIS to approve funding.
- **Highlights Your Goals:** A good report aligns the recommendations with your personal goals, showing how the right support will help you achieve them.
- **Reduces Review Requests:** A clear, comprehensive report can prevent back-and-forth with the NDIS, leading to a faster, smoother planning process.

## The Anatomy of a High-Quality FCA Report (An Example)

Let's break down what a good Functional Capacity Assessment report example contains. We've structured this like a real report, explaining the purpose of each section.

### 1. Cover Page & Client Details

This is the first page of the report. It should be professional and easy to read.

---
**Example Section: Cover Page**

**Confidential Functional Capacity Assessment Report**

- **Client Name:** [Your Name]
- **NDIS Number:** [Your NDIS Number]
- **Date of Birth:** [Your DOB]
- **Date of Assessment:** [Date]
- **Date of Report:** [Date]
- **Assessor Name & Title:** [e.g., Jane Doe, Occupational Therapist]
- **Provider Name & Number:** [e.g., MD Home Care, NDIS Provider No: XXXXXXX]

---

**Why it's important:** This section provides all the essential identifying information at a glance, ensuring the report is correctly filed with your NDIS plan.

### 2. Introduction & Scope of Assessment

This part sets the scene. It explains who requested the assessment, why it was done, and what it covers.

---
**Example Section: Introduction**

*This Functional Capacity Assessment was conducted at the request of [Client Name] to assess their functional capacity and provide recommendations for reasonable and necessary supports for their NDIS plan. The assessment was conducted at the client's home on [Date] and focused on evaluating their ability to perform daily living tasks within the domains of self-care, mobility, and community participation.*

---

**Why it's important:** This clarifies the report's purpose and manages expectations about what is and isn't covered.

### 3. Background Information & Medical History

This section gives the NDIS context about you and your disability. It includes your living situation, support network, and relevant medical history.

---
**Example Section: Background**

- **Living Situation:** Lives alone in a two-story house.
- **Support Network:** Receives informal support from their daughter twice a week.
- **Primary Disability:** [e.g., Multiple Sclerosis, diagnosed in 2018]
- **Secondary Conditions:** [e.g., Chronic fatigue, anxiety]
- **Relevant Medical History:** Summary of diagnoses, treatments, and current medications.

---

**Why it's important:** This paints a holistic picture of your life and the environment in which you need support.

### 4. Assessment Methodology

This section lists the professional tools and methods the assessor used. This is crucial for showing the report is evidence-based.

---
**Example Section: Methodology**

*The following standardized assessment tools and processes were used:*
- *World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0)*
- *In-home observation of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)*
- *Semi-structured interview with the client and their primary carer*
- *Review of previous medical and therapy reports*

---

**Why it's important:** It demonstrates that the assessor's findings are based on objective, industry-recognized methods, adding weight and credibility to the recommendations.

### 5. Functional Capacity Evaluation Findings

This is the heart of the report. It details the assessor's findings for different areas of your life, often broken down by NDIS life domains.

---
**Example Section: Findings**

#### Self-Care
*Client has significant difficulty with showering and dressing due to fatigue and limited mobility. They require sit-down rests and adaptive equipment. It currently takes the client 45 minutes to shower and dress, posing a safety risk.*

#### Mobility
*Client can walk for up to 10 minutes with a walking stick before needing to rest. They are unable to use public transport independently due to physical access challenges and anxiety.*

#### Social & Community Participation
*Client expresses a strong desire to rejoin their local community garden but is unable to due to transportation difficulties and the physical demands of gardening.*

---

**Why it's important:** This section provides the specific, concrete evidence the NDIS needs to understand how your disability impacts you day-to-day.

### 6. Summary of Key Findings

This is a concise summary of the most important points from the evaluation.

---
**Example Section: Summary**

*Overall, [Client Name]'s functional capacity is significantly impacted by their [Disability]. The key areas of concern are self-care, community access, and home maintenance. Without appropriate support, the client is at risk of social isolation and physical injury.*

---

**Why it's important:** It gives the NDIS planner a quick, high-level overview of your needs.

### 7. Recommendations & Accommodations

This is the most critical section for your funding. It links the findings directly to recommended supports and explains why they are "reasonable and necessary."

---
**Example Section: Recommendations**

*Based on the assessment findings, the following supports are recommended:*
1. ***Improved Daily Living (CB Daily Activity):*** *5 hours per week of support from a support worker to assist with showering, meal preparation, and home safety.*
    - ***Justification:*** *To reduce fatigue, ensure safety, and improve overall wellbeing.*
2. ***Improved Relationships (CB Social):*** *Funding for a support worker for 4 hours per week to facilitate community access, enabling the client to attend their community garden.*
    - ***Justification:*** *To support the client's goals, reduce social isolation, and improve mental health.*
3. ***Assistive Technology:*** *Funding for a shower chair and non-slip bathmat.*
    - ***Justification:*** *To mitigate the high risk of falls identified during the in-home assessment.*

---

**Why it's important:** This section tells the NDIS exactly what you need and why you need it, using their own language and categories.

## FCA Cost and Funding (2025)

Understanding what an FCA costs and how to fund it:

### Typical FCA Costs

| Service Type | Cost Range | What's Included |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Standard FCA** (1-3 sessions + report) | $800 - $1,500 | Full assessment across all domains, comprehensive report |
| **Targeted FCA** (specific focus) | $600 - $1,200 | Equipment or home modification justification |
| **Review FCA** (follow-up) | $500 - $900 | Update after 12-24 months |

### How to Fund Your FCA

| Funding Option | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| **Capacity Building Budget** | Use Improved Daily Living funding (if available in your plan) |
| **Plan Review Request** | Ask NDIA to add FCA funding specifically |
| **Private Payment** | Pay out-of-pocket, then use report for next plan review |
| **NDIS Access Request** | For new participants, some assessments may be covered |

> **Important:** If you don't have FCA funding in your current plan, you can request it at your plan review or lodge a change of circumstances request if you need an FCA before your scheduled review.

## How Long Does an FCA Take?

| Stage | Timeframe |
|-------|-----------|
| **Initial booking** | 1-2 weeks (depending on provider availability) |
| **Your preparation** | Up to 1 week to gather documents |
| **Assessment sessions** | 1-3 sessions over 1-2 weeks |
| **Report writing** | 7-14 days after final session |
| **Total turnaround** | 3-5 weeks from first contact to final report |

## How to Prepare for Your Functional Capacity Assessment

Thorough preparation leads to a better, more accurate report. Here's what to do:

### Pre-Assessment Checklist

| Area | What to Prepare |
|------|-----------------|
| **Medical Documents** | GP letters, hospital summaries, previous therapy reports, specialist reports |
| **Current Supports** | List of formal services and informal carer support you receive |
| **Equipment** | List of assistive devices you already use (walking aids, shower chairs, etc.) |
| **Goals** | Write down what you want to achieve with NDIS funding |
| **Daily Challenges** | Keep a diary for 1-2 weeks noting difficult tasks, how long they take, how you feel |
| **Support Person** | Arrange for a carer or family member who knows your routine to attend |

### Environment Preparation (For Home Visits)

- Tidy the areas where you'll be observed (kitchen, bathroom, bedroom)
- Have your usual assistive devices accessible
- Don't "clean up" to hide challenges—show your real daily environment
- Ensure safe access for the assessor

### On Assessment Day

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Be honest about your challenges | Put on a "brave face" |
| Demonstrate how you actually do tasks | Do things differently to impress |
| Mention your worst days, not just today | Minimise your difficulties |
| Ask questions if you don't understand | Rush through activities |
| Show the impact of fatigue/pain | Hide symptoms or limitations |

## What If You Disagree With Your Report?

If you receive your report and feel it doesn't accurately represent your needs, you have options.
1.  **Contact the Assessor:** Your first step should be to talk to the therapist who wrote the report. There may have been a misunderstanding that can be easily corrected.
2.  **Request an Addendum:** The assessor may be able to add an amendment or addendum to the report to include missing information or clarify a point.
3.  **Seek a Second Opinion:** If you cannot resolve the issue, you are entitled to get a second assessment from a different provider.

## Common Assessment Tools Used in FCAs

Assessors use standardised, evidence-based tools to measure your function. Common tools include:

| Assessment Tool | What It Measures |
|-----------------|------------------|
| **Functional Independence Measure (FIM)** | Overall level of independence in daily activities |
| **WHODAS 2.0** | Disability impact across multiple life domains |
| **Modified Barthel Index** | ADL (Activities of Daily Living) independence |
| **Berg Balance Scale** | Balance and fall risk |
| **Australian Therapy Outcome Measures (AusTOMs)** | Functional outcomes across domains |
| **Assessment of Communication and Interaction Skills (ACIS)** | Communication effectiveness |

The specific tools used depend on your disability and what needs to be assessed.

## How Your FCA Impacts NDIS Funding

Your FCA report directly influences funding decisions across multiple categories:

| NDIS Category | How FCA Influences It |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| **Capacity Building (Therapy)** | Demonstrates need for ongoing OT, physio, psychology hours |
| **Capital (Equipment)** | Provides clinical proof equipment is reasonable and necessary |
| **Capital (Home Modifications)** | Shows functional limitation the modification addresses |
| **Core Supports** | Evidence for level of personal care/transport needed |
| **SDA/SIL** | Justifies high-level accommodation or 24/7 support |

> **Key Point:** Without a quality FCA, the NDIS may under-fund or reject requests for high-cost items because they lack clinical evidence of need.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does a functional capacity assessment cost in 2025?
A standard FCA costs $800-$1,500 depending on complexity. Targeted assessments for specific equipment may cost $600-$1,200. Most FCAs are funded through your Capacity Building budget under Improved Daily Living.

### Who can perform a functional capacity assessment for NDIS?
FCAs are conducted by qualified Allied Health professionals registered with AHPRA. Occupational Therapists (OTs) are most common, but physiotherapists and psychologists can also conduct them depending on what's being assessed.

### How long is a functional capacity report valid for?
There's no official expiry date, but reports are a "snapshot in time." The NDIS typically accepts reports for 2-3 years unless your circumstances change significantly. For SDA or SIL applications, more recent reports (within 12 months) are preferred.

### What is the difference between FCA and functional assessment?
These terms are often used interchangeably in the NDIS context. Both refer to clinical evaluations of how disability impacts daily function. Some providers use "functional assessment" for shorter, targeted evaluations and "functional capacity assessment" for comprehensive evaluations.

### Can I get an FCA if I don't have funding for it?
Yes. Options include:
- Requesting FCA funding at your plan review
- Lodging a change of circumstances request
- Paying privately and using the report for future funding requests
- Checking if the assessor offers payment plans

### What happens after I get my FCA report?
Submit the report to your NDIA planner, LAC, or Support Coordinator. They'll use it as evidence for your next plan review or any current funding requests. Keep a copy for your records.

### How do I choose a good FCA assessor?
Look for:
- AHPRA registration (for OTs, physios, psychologists)
- Experience with NDIS participants
- Familiarity with your type of disability
- Willingness to do home visits if needed
- Clear communication about process and costs
