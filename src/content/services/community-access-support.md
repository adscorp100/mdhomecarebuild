## More Than Just a Ride in {suburb}: It's About Connection & Community.

Living a full and vibrant life means being a part of your community in {suburb}. It's visiting friends, going to the library, attending appointments, or simply enjoying a coffee at your favourite local cafe. But for many NDIS participants, getting out and about can be challenging.
