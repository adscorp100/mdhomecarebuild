## NDIS Progress Notes Template: Key Points
- Progress notes document each support session using the SOAP format: Subjective (participant's perspective), Objective (observations), Assessment (analysis), and Plan (next steps).
- Quality progress notes link activities to NDIS goals, demonstrating how supports contribute to participant outcomes.
- Progress notes must be completed after every support session and kept for at least 7 years for NDIS Commission compliance.
- Well-written notes protect participants, support workers, and providers while providing evidence of quality service delivery.
