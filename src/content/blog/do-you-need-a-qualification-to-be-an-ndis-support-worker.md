## Do You Need a Qualification to Be an NDIS Support Worker: Key Points
- While there is no mandated minimum qualification to become an NDIS support worker, most employers and participants prefer workers with at least a Certificate III in Individual Support or equivalent.
- All support workers must complete mandatory NDIS Worker Screening, have a valid Working with Vulnerable People check, and hold current First Aid and CPR certification.
- Specialized roles (e.g., behavior support, complex care) typically require higher qualifications such as a Certificate IV, Diploma, or degree in a relevant field.
- Ongoing professional development and specialized training significantly improve employment opportunities and earning potential.

## NDIS Support Worker Qualification Requirements
While the NDIS itself doesn't mandate specific qualifications for all support workers, the sector has established clear expectations for different roles:

- **Entry-Level Support Work**: No formal qualification required, but a Certificate III in Individual Support (CHC33015) is highly recommended and increasingly expected by employers and participants.
- **Specialized Support Work**: Certificate IV in Disability (CHC43115) or equivalent typically required for roles involving more complex support needs.
- **Advanced Roles**: Diploma-level qualifications or higher needed for specialized areas like positive behavior support, complex health support, or coordination roles.
- **Mandatory Requirements**: All support workers must have:
  - NDIS Worker Screening clearance
  - Working with Vulnerable People Check (or state equivalent)
  - First Aid and CPR certification
  - COVID-19 vaccination (as per current health directives)

The level of qualification needed also depends on the specific support categories you'll be delivering and the complexity of participants' needs.
