A Level 4 Home Care Package is the highest level of support available through the Australian Government, providing **$79,473** in annual funding for older Australians with complex, high-level care needs.

For families and caregivers navigating this stage, a Level 4 package can be a lifeline, enabling loved ones to remain safely at home for as long as possible. This guide provides clear, direct answers about Level 4 funding, the services it covers, and how to navigate the critical decisions that come with high-level care.

## Who is a Level 4 Package For?

A Level 4 Home Care Package is for individuals who have been assessed by an Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) as having **high-level or complex care needs**. This typically includes those who:
- Require comprehensive and coordinated services.
- Need assistance with a wide range of daily activities.
- Have complex health conditions requiring clinical or nursing support.
- Might otherwise need to consider moving into a residential aged care facility.

## Funding: How Much Do I Get in 2025?

As of the latest government figures for 2025, a Level 4 Home Care Package provides an annual subsidy of **$79,473**.

This funding significantly increases the amount of support available compared to lower-level packages, reflecting the intensive nature of care required.

## How Many Hours of Care Does That Provide?

The funding for a Level 4 package translates to approximately **20-28 hours of care per fortnight**.

This figure can vary based on the provider's fees and the mix of services you choose. For example, specialized nursing care costs more per hour than domestic assistance, which will affect the total hours you can receive. Choosing a provider with low administrative fees is key to maximizing your care hours.

## What Services Can I Access?

A Level 4 package is designed to fund a comprehensive range of services, with a strong focus on clinical support to manage complex health needs.

### Specialized Clinical & Nursing Services
- **Complex Wound Care:** Management of chronic or complex wounds by trained nurses.
- **Continence Management:** Development and supervision of a personalized continence plan.
- **Medication Management:** For complex medication schedules.
- **Palliative Care Support:** End-of-life care and symptom management at home.
- **Post-Hospitalization Care:** High-level support and rehabilitation after a hospital stay.
- **Chronic Disease Management:** Nursing support for conditions like diabetes, heart failure, or dementia.

### Home Modifications & Assistive Technology
- **Major Bathroom Modifications:** Installing walk-in showers or accessible toilets.
- **Stair Lifts:** To allow safe access to different levels of the home.
- **Ramps and Handrails:** For improved mobility and safety.
- **Specialized Mobility Aids:** Funding towards wheelchairs or other complex mobility equipment.

## Checklist for Choosing a Level 4 Provider

Selecting a provider for high-level care is a critical decision. Your provider must have proven experience in managing complex needs. Use this checklist when interviewing them:

- **Complex Care Experience:** "Can you provide examples of how you've managed care for clients with needs similar to mine?"
- **24/7 Support:** "What are your procedures for after-hours emergencies, and what on-call support is available?"
- **Clinical Governance:** "How do you ensure your nursing and clinical services meet the highest safety and quality standards?"
- **Managing Transitions:** "What is your experience in supporting clients who may eventually transition to residential care?"
- **Staff Qualifications:** "What specific training and qualifications do your staff have for high-level and palliative care?"

## The Transition to Residential Care

For many families, a Level 4 package is a crucial tool for delaying the move to residential care. However, it can also be used to support a safe and dignified transition when the time is right.

Community forums show that the "tipping point" for families often involves caregiver burnout or a decline in the person's health that makes staying at home unsafe, even with significant support.

A Level 4 package can be used to:
- **Fund Respite Care:** Giving primary caregivers a much-needed break.
- **Support Transition Planning:** Funding consultations and assessments to ensure a smooth move.
- **Coordinate Care:** Your provider can liaise with the residential facility to ensure a seamless handover of care.

## Level 4 Home Care Package vs. NDIS

It's important to understand the difference between these two government programs:
- **Home Care Packages:** Are for older Australians, generally **age 65 and over**.
- **National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS):** Is for Australians with a significant and permanent disability, **under the age of 65**.

You cannot receive funding from both programs at the same time. The key factor is your age at the time of application.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the main difference between a Level 3 and a Level 4 package?
The primary difference is the level of care and funding. A Level 3 package is for intermediate needs ($40,945.70 subsidy), while a Level 4 package is for high and complex needs ($79,473 subsidy) and includes funding for more intensive clinical and nursing support.

### Can a Level 4 package cover 24-hour care?
No. While a Level 4 package provides substantial support, the funding is not sufficient to cover 24/7 care. It is designed to provide a high level of support to allow someone to remain at home, often with the help of family caregivers.

### What happens to the package funds if the person passes away?
Any unspent funds in the Home Care Package, after all provider fees have been paid, are returned to the government and the individual's estate.
