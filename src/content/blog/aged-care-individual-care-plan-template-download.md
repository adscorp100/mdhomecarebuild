## What is an Aged Care Individual Care Plan?

An Individual Care Plan (ICP) is a detailed, person-centered document that outlines the specific care and support needs of an aged care client. It serves as the primary guide for all care staff, ensuring consistent, coordinated, and personalized care delivery.

### Step 3: Develop Person-Centered Goals
Work collaboratively with the client and family to set goals that:

### Step 5: Assess and Plan for Risks
For each identified risk:
- Rate the level of risk (low, medium, high)
- Identify contributing factors
- Develop specific management strategies
- Assign responsibility for monitoring
- Set review dates

### Step 6: Document the Care Plan

- Explore compromise solutions
- Involve the GP or specialists in discussions
- Document decisions and reasons
- Respect the client's choices (if they have capacity)

### Challenge: Care Plan Becomes Outdated Quickly

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Who is responsible for creating the care plan?**
A registered nurse or appropriately qualified care coordinator typically develops the care plan, with input from the client, family, GP, and multidisciplinary team.

**How often must care plans be reviewed?**
At minimum, annually. However, they should be reviewed whenever the client's condition or needs change significantly.

**Can a client refuse to have a care plan?**
While care plans are required for accreditation, the client has the right to choose not to participate. Document this choice and develop the plan based on available information and professional judgment.

**What if the client's family wants care that's not recommended?**
Discuss concerns openly, explain clinical reasoning, and seek compromise. If agreement can't be reached, document the discussion and the client's/family's choice. Involve the GP or ethics committee if needed.

**How detailed should a care plan be?**
Detailed enough that any staff member can provide consistent, appropriate care, but not so detailed it becomes unmanageable. Focus on what's essential and variable.

**Can care plans be electronic?**
Yes. Many facilities use electronic care planning systems. Ensure all staff can access them and that there's a backup for system failures.
