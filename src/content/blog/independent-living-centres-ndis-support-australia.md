# Accessing NDIS Support Through Independent Living Centres in Australia

## Key Points
- Independent Living Centres (ILCs) provide free, independent advice and equipment trials for people with disabilities, including NDIS participants

## Understanding Independent Living Centres

Independent Living Centres (ILCs) are not-for-profit organizations that provide free, independent information and advice about assistive technology, equipment, and disability-related products. Unlike commercial suppliers, ILCs don't sell equipment but instead focus on providing unbiased advice to help people with disabilities make informed choices about assistive technology and daily living aids.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do Independent Living Centres differ from equipment suppliers?
Independent Living Centres provide unbiased information and advice without selling equipment, while suppliers have commercial interests in promoting their products. ILCs focus on helping you make informed decisions based on your needs, preferences, and circumstances. They offer trials and demonstrations without pressure to purchase, and their advice considers all available options rather than just one supplier's range. ILCs also provide ongoing support and problem-solving assistance independent of any commercial relationship.

### Are ILC services really free, and what's included?
Yes, ILC services are genuinely free, funded through government grants and charitable sources. Free services typically include information provision, equipment advice, professional consultations, equipment trials, and ongoing support. This includes access to display centers, phone consultations, equipment databases, and professional assessments by qualified staff. However, if you choose to have extensive home visits or require formal written reports for legal purposes, some ILCs may charge fees. Always clarify what's included when arranging services.

### How long does it take to get advice from an ILC?
Timeframes vary depending on the complexity of your needs and ILC capacity. Simple information requests can often be handled immediately by phone or email. Equipment trials can typically be arranged within 1-2 weeks, though popular items may have waiting lists. Professional consultations are usually available within 2-4 weeks. Complex assessments requiring home visits may take longer to arrange. Contact your local ILC early in your decision-making process to allow adequate time for thorough consideration.

### Can ILCs help with NDIS plan reviews and funding applications?
ILCs can provide valuable support for NDIS processes, including documentation of equipment needs, professional opinions on assistive technology requirements, and evidence for plan reviews. They can help you understand what information NDIS planners need and assist with preparing justifications for equipment requests. However, ILCs don't directly advocate with the NDIA or attend planning meetings. They provide independent professional advice that you can use in your NDIS interactions.

### Do I need a referral to access ILC services?
No referral is required to access ILC services - you can contact them directly. However, referrals from healthcare professionals, NDIS providers, or other services are welcome and can provide useful background information. Self-referral is common and encouraged, as ILCs are designed to be accessible to anyone seeking information about assistive technology and equipment. Whether referred or self-referred, you'll receive the same quality of service and attention.

### What should I bring to an ILC consultation or trial?
Bring any relevant medical reports, NDIS plans, current equipment, and a list of your questions and concerns. If you use mobility aids, bring them for comparison. Consider bringing family members or carers who assist you daily, as their insights can be valuable. Wear comfortable clothing suitable for equipment trials, and bring any special seating cushions or supports you regularly use. Also bring a notebook to record information and recommendations for later reference.
