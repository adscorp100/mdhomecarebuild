## NDIS Respite Care Rates 2024-25

The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) provides respite care and short-term accommodation (STA) to support people with disabilities and their caregivers. Respite care specifically gives caregivers a break, while STA provides temporary housing and care, often for skill development or a change of environment.

## NDIS Respite Price Guide: How Much Does Respite Care Cost Per Day?

These services benefit both participants and caregivers. Costs depend on several factors:
- Staff-to-participant ratios (1:1 to 1:4)
- Day of the week (weekday, weekend, or public holiday)
- Location (national, remote, very remote)

The latest pricing, effective from October 1, 2024, is detailed below.

## NDIS Respite Holidays and Accommodation Options

While NDIS does fund respite care, it's important to understand that this funding cannot be used for general family vacations. Respite stays typically need to serve specific purposes related to your disability support needs and align with the goals in your NDIS plan.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between NDIS Short-Term Accommodation (STA) and respite care?
Although often used interchangeably, STA is the formal NDIS term for temporary accommodation with support services. Respite care specifically focuses on giving caregivers a break. In practice, STA is the broader category that includes respite care as one of its purposes. The NDIS pricing structure applies the same rates to both.

### How are NDIS respite care rates calculated for 2024-25?
NDIS respite rates for 2024-25 are calculated based on three key factors: staff-to-participant ratio (1:1 to 1:4), day of the week (weekday, Saturday, Sunday, public holiday), and location (national, remote, very remote). For example, a 1:4 ratio standard weekday stay costs $684.96 nationally, while a 1:1 public holiday stay in a very remote location reaches $6,166.20 per day.

### Is transport included in the NDIS respite price guide?
No, transport to and from respite facilities is not included in the daily rates. Transport must be funded separately, typically from your Core Supports - Transport budget. Discuss transport arrangements and associated costs with your provider before booking.

### What happens if I need to cancel my NDIS short term accommodation booking?
As of October 2024, you must provide 2 clear business days' notice for canceling. With less notice, providers can charge 100% of the agreed price for the first day only. Check your service agreement for specific terms, as providers may have their own policies.

### Can I use NDIS funded respite for holidays?
NDIS respite funding cannot be used for general family vacations. Respite must directly relate to your disability support needs and align with your NDIS plan goals. Only disability-specific support and accommodation costs for the participant might be covered, with strong justification required.

### Are meals included in the NDIS respite care rates?
Yes, standard meals and food costs are included in the daily rates. Basic meals and snacks are always covered, but specialty dietary requirements or dining out might incur additional charges. Discuss meal arrangements in advance to avoid unexpected costs.

### How many days of NDIS respite funding can I get in my plan?
Typical allocations range from 14-28 days per year, based on individual needs and circumstances. Factors affecting your allocation include your current care arrangements, caregiver stress levels, other available supports, and how respite aligns with your overall goals. For stays longer than 14 consecutive days, Medium Term Accommodation (MTA) might be more appropriate.

### Where can I find the official NDIS STA price guide?
