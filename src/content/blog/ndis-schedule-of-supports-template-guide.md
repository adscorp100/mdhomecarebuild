# NDIS Schedule of Supports: Free Template & Complete Guide

Your NDIS Schedule of Supports is the roadmap to your funding—but for many participants, it can look like a confusing spreadsheet of codes and numbers. Understanding this document is essential for getting the most out of your NDIS plan.

This complete guide explains exactly what a schedule of supports is, how to read your NDIS Schedule of Supports, what each category means, the difference between stated and flexible supports, and provides a **free downloadable template** you can use to track your spending throughout your plan period.

## What is an NDIS Schedule of Supports?

An NDIS Schedule of Supports (also called a support schedule or schedule of funded supports) is the detailed breakdown inside your NDIS plan that lists every funded support you're approved to receive. Think of it as your plan's itemized budget allocation document.

Your NDIS Schedule of Supports shows:
- **What** supports you're funded for (specific support items by name and code)
- **How much** funding is allocated (dollar amounts per item)
- **How many** units you can access (hours, sessions, or items)
- **How** the plan is managed (NDIA-managed, plan-managed, or self-managed)
- **When** the funding is available (start and end dates)
- **Price limits** (maximum rates providers can charge)

### Why Your Schedule of Supports Matters

Understanding your NDIS Schedule of Supports is crucial because:
- It determines what services you can access and how much you can spend
- Different line items have different levels of flexibility (stated vs flexible)
- Tracking against your schedule prevents overspending or underspending
- Knowing your allocations helps you plan services across the year
- Unused funding doesn't roll over - if you don't use it, you lose it

### Where to Find Your NDIS Schedule of Supports

Your Schedule of Supports appears in several places:
- **In your NDIS plan document** (usually pages 2-4 of the PDF sent when your plan is approved)
- **In the MyPlace participant portal** under "My Plan" → "Support Schedule"
- **From your Support Coordinator** or Plan Manager (they can provide an explained copy)
- **From your LAC** (Local Area Coordinator) if you're working with one

## Understanding the Schedule of Supports Layout

Your schedule is organised into columns. Here's what each one means:

| Column | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Support Category** | Core, Capacity Building, or Capital |
| **Support Item Code** | A numbered code (e.g., 15_056_0128_1_3) that identifies the specific support |
| **Support Item Name** | Plain English description (e.g., "Occupational Therapy") |
| **Units** | Number of hours, sessions, or items approved |
| **Price Limit** | Maximum amount providers can charge per unit |
| **Total Budget** | Units × Price Limit = your allocation for that item |
| **Provider** | If pre-allocated, the provider's name |
| **Period** | Start and end dates of the funding |

### Reading Line Items

Let's look at a typical line item:

```
Category: Capacity Building - Daily Living
Code: 15_056_0128_1_3
Name: Occupational Therapy
Units: 20 hours
Price Limit: $193.99/hour
Total: $3,879.80
Period: 01 Jul 2025 - 30 Jun 2026
```

This tells you:
- You have 20 hours of occupational therapy funded
- Providers can charge up to $193.99 per hour
- Your total OT budget is $3,879.80 for the year

## The Three Support Categories Explained

All NDIS funding falls into three main categories:

### 1. Core Supports

Core Supports help with everyday activities and current disability-related needs. This is typically the largest portion of your plan.

| Core Support Type | What It Covers | Example Items |
|-------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Assistance with Daily Life** | Personal care, household tasks | Support workers, cleaning, meal prep |
| **Consumables** | Everyday items | Continence products, low-cost AT |
| **Assistance with Social & Community Participation** | Getting out and about | Support worker to attend activities |
| **Transport** | Getting to appointments and activities | Taxi/rideshare, support worker travel |

**Key feature:** Core Supports are generally **flexible within the category**. You can shift funding between different Core items as needed (except for some stated items).

### 2. Capacity Building Supports

Capacity Building Supports help you build skills and independence over time. This funding is designed to help you need less support in the future.

| CB Support Type | What It Covers | Example Items |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Support Coordination** | Help managing your plan | Support Coordinator services |
| **Improved Daily Living** | Therapy and assessments | OT, physio, psychology, speech |
| **Improved Relationships** | Social skills, behaviour support | Behaviour support practitioners |
| **Improved Life Choices** | Plan management | Plan Manager fees |
| **Employment** | Finding and keeping work | Employment support |
| **Health & Wellbeing** | Exercise and health management | Exercise physiology, dietitian |

**Key feature:** Capacity Building is generally **not flexible** between categories. You can't use therapy funding for support coordination, for example.

### 3. Capital Supports

Capital Supports are for larger, one-off investments like equipment and home modifications.

| Capital Support Type | What It Covers | Examples |
|---------------------|----------------|----------|
| **Assistive Technology** | Equipment and devices | Wheelchairs, communication devices |
| **Home Modifications** | Changes to your home | Ramps, bathroom modifications |
| **Vehicle Modifications** | Changes to vehicles | Wheelchair hoists, hand controls |

**Key feature:** Capital Supports are **very specific**. Each item must be individually approved and is usually stated (not flexible).

## Stated vs Flexible Supports

Understanding the difference between stated and flexible supports is crucial for managing your plan effectively.

### Stated Supports

Stated supports are specifically listed in your schedule with a defined amount. They're often:
- For specific purposes (like home modifications)
- Required for compliance reasons
- High-cost items needing NDIA approval

**Example:** "Wheelchair - $5,000" is a stated support. You can only use that $5,000 for the wheelchair.

### Flexible Supports

Flexible supports give you choice within a category. The funding is available but not locked to a specific item.

**Example:** "$8,000 - Core Supports" might let you choose between more support worker hours, transport, or consumables—whatever you need most.

### How to Tell the Difference

| Indicator | Likely Stated | Likely Flexible |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Specific item named | ✅ | |
| General category budget | | ✅ |
| High-cost capital item | ✅ | |
| Core Supports | Sometimes | Usually |
| Capacity Building | Usually | Sometimes |

> **Pro tip:** If you're unsure, ask your Support Coordinator or call the NDIS. Using stated funding for the wrong purpose can create compliance issues.

## Plan Management Options

How your plan is managed affects how you access your Schedule of Supports:

### NDIA-Managed (Agency-Managed)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who manages** | The NDIA processes all claims |
| **Provider choice** | Must use registered providers only |
| **Your admin** | Minimal—providers claim directly |
| **Flexibility** | Limited |

**Best for:** People who want minimal paperwork and are happy using registered providers.

### Plan-Managed

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who manages** | A Plan Management provider |
| **Provider choice** | Can use registered AND unregistered providers |
| **Your admin** | Low—plan manager handles claims |
| **Flexibility** | High |
| **Cost** | Plan management fee comes from your plan |

**Best for:** People who want flexibility without the admin burden.

### Self-Managed

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who manages** | You (or a nominee) |
| **Provider choice** | Can use anyone |
| **Your admin** | High—you process all claims |
| **Flexibility** | Maximum |
| **Cost** | No management fee |

**Best for:** People comfortable with admin who want maximum control.

### Can You Mix Management Types?

Yes. You can have different categories managed differently. For example:
- Core Supports: Self-managed
- Capacity Building: Plan-managed
- Capital: NDIA-managed

This is called a "mixed management" arrangement.

### How to Use the Template

1. **Enter your plan details** when you receive your new plan
2. **Update "Used" column** after each service or invoice
3. **Calculate "Remaining"** to see what's left
4. **Add notes** about pacing (are you using too fast? too slow?)
5. **Review monthly** to avoid underspending or overspending

### Pacing Your Budget

A common mistake is running out of funding before your plan ends—or having unused funds that expire.

**Simple pacing calculation:**
- Divide your annual budget by 12 = monthly target
- Track whether you're ahead or behind

**Example:**
- Annual Core budget: $24,000
- Monthly target: $2,000
- If you've spent $2,500 in month 1, you're $500 over pace

## Common Schedule of Supports Questions

### Can I move money between categories?

**Generally no.** You cannot move funding from Core to Capacity Building or vice versa. However:
- You CAN usually move funds within Core categories
- Some Capacity Building funds are flexible within that category
- Capital funds are almost never flexible

If you need to change your category allocations, you'll need a plan review.

### What happens to unused funding?

Unused funding at the end of your plan period **does not roll over**. It's lost. This is why tracking your spending is important—you want to use what you need, not leave money on the table.

### Can I spend more than my allocated amount?

No. Once a category is exhausted, you cannot access more funding until your next plan (unless you request a plan review due to changed circumstances).

### What if a line item runs out but I still have category budget?

If your schedule shows flexible funding within a category, you may be able to continue accessing services using the remaining category budget. Check with your Support Coordinator or Plan Manager.

### How do I know if my plan is on track?

**Quick check:**
- Calculate what percentage of your plan period has passed
- Compare to what percentage of budget you've used
- They should roughly match

**Example:** 6 months into a 12-month plan (50%), you should have used approximately 50% of your budget.

## Tips for Managing Your Schedule of Supports

### 1. Review Your Plan Immediately
When you receive a new plan, check:
- Are the funded items what you expected?
- Are the amounts reasonable for your needs?
- Is anything missing that you requested?

Request a review within 3 months if something is wrong.

### 2. Set Up a Tracking System
Whether it's our template, your Plan Manager's portal, or the MyPlace system—track your spending from day one.

### 3. Communicate with Your Support Coordinator
Your Support Coordinator can:
- Help you understand your schedule
- Identify flexibility in your funding
- Alert you to pacing issues
- Help request changes if needed

### 4. Plan for the End of Plan Period
About 2-3 months before your plan ends:
- Review what's left unspent
- Book any needed assessments or reports
- Use remaining therapy hours
- Prepare for your plan review meeting

### 5. Keep Records
Save:
- Invoices from all providers
- Service agreements
- Receipts (especially for self-managed)
- Notes about what worked and didn't

These help at plan review time.

## When to Request a Plan Review

You can request a plan review if:
- Your circumstances have changed significantly
- You need different types of support
- Your funding is running out too quickly
- You're not using your funding because it doesn't match your needs
- You've had a major life change (moved house, started work, health crisis)

Don't wait until your plan is exhausted—request reviews early when you notice issues.

## Frequently Asked Questions About NDIS Schedule of Supports

### What is a schedule of supports?

A schedule of supports is the detailed section of your NDIS plan that lists every funded support item you're approved to receive, including specific dollar amounts, units (hours/sessions), price limits, and management type. It's essentially your NDIS budget breakdown showing exactly what services you can access and how much funding is allocated to each.

### What's the difference between a plan and a Schedule of Supports?

Your **NDIS plan** is the overall document outlining your goals, needs, and funding approach. The **Schedule of Supports** is the specific section (usually 2-4 pages) within that plan listing exactly what supports are funded and how much is allocated to each item. Think of the plan as the full document and the schedule as the detailed budget breakdown.

### How do I read my NDIS Schedule of Supports?

To read your NDIS Schedule of Supports, look at each line item which shows:
1. The support category (Core, Capacity Building, or Capital)
2. The support item code (e.g., 15_056_0128_1_3)
3. The support name (e.g., "Occupational Therapy")
4. Units approved (e.g., 20 hours)
5. Price limit (e.g., $193.99/hour)
6. Total budget (units × price limit)

Each line represents a specific funded support you can access during your plan period.

### Where can I download a schedule of supports template?

Use the free template in this guide above, or download our comprehensive NDIS Schedule of Supports tracking template [here](/downloads/ndis-schedule-supports-template-2026.xlsx). The template includes columns for tracking used vs remaining funds, pacing calculations, and notes to help you manage your budget throughout your plan period.

### How often does my Schedule of Supports change?

Your NDIS Schedule of Supports is set for your plan period (usually 12-24 months). It only changes if:
- You request and receive a plan review due to changed circumstances
- Your plan period ends and you receive a new plan
- The NDIA approves a variation to your current plan

Regular price guide updates don't change your schedule - your approved dollar amounts stay the same until your next plan.

### Can I move money between line items in my schedule of supports?

It depends on whether funding is stated or flexible:
- **Within Core Supports**: Usually yes - Core funding is generally flexible within the category
- **Between categories** (Core to Capacity Building): No - you cannot move funding between different support categories
- **Capacity Building**: Sometimes - depends on how your plan is structured
- **Capital**: Rarely - Capital items are almost always stated for specific purposes

Check with your Support Coordinator or Plan Manager if you're unsure about your specific plan's flexibility.

### Can I change providers without changing my schedule?

Yes, in most cases you can change providers while keeping the same Schedule of Supports funding allocation. Your schedule funds the *type of support*, not usually a specific provider (unless a provider is specifically stated in your plan). As long as the new provider offers the same service and charges within your price limits, you can switch freely.

### What happens to unused schedule of supports funding?

Unused funding in your NDIS Schedule of Supports does not roll over to your next plan. Any funds not spent by the end of your plan period are lost. This is why tracking your spending against your schedule is crucial - you want to use all the funding you need without running out early or leaving money unspent.

### What if I don't understand my schedule?

If you're struggling to understand your NDIS Schedule of Supports, contact:
- Your Support Coordinator (they're specifically funded to help with this)
- Your Plan Manager (they can provide spending reports)
- Your LAC (Local Area Coordinator)
- The NDIS helpline: 1800 800 110
- A disability advocate or support organization

Never feel embarrassed to ask for help understanding your plan - it's a complex document and asking questions is part of getting the most from your NDIS funding.
