A government-funded personal alarm can be a lifeline, providing seniors and people with disabilities the confidence to live independently at home. These devices offer a direct line to help in an emergency, and various national and state-based programs can make them free or significantly cheaper.

This guide explains the different funding options available in 2025, including national programs like My Aged Care and state-specific rebates.

## How Can I Get a Government Funded Personal Alarm?

There are several pathways to getting a personal alarm funded by the government. The right one for you depends on your age, location, and circumstances.

**The main funding programs are:**
-   **My Aged Care:** For seniors over 65, primarily through the Commonwealth Home Support Programme (CHSP) and the new Support at Home program (from July 2025).
-   **National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS):** For people with a permanent and significant disability.
-   **State-Based Rebate Schemes:** Specific programs in Victoria, South Australia, NSW, and WA that offer direct rebates or free systems.
-   **Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA):** For eligible veterans and their families.

## National Funding: My Aged Care & NDIS

### My Aged Care
For most seniors, **My Aged Care** is the first point of contact. By calling **1800 200 422**, you can arrange for an assessment. If eligible, you may receive funding for a personal alarm through:
1.  **Commonwealth Home Support Programme (CHSP):** Provides entry-level support, which can include a personal alarm.
2.  **Support at Home Program:** From 1 July 2025, this new program replaces Home Care Packages and aims to streamline access to services like personal alarms.

### National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS)
If you have a permanent disability, the NDIS can fund personal alarms as part of your plan, often under "Assistive Technology." This can include more advanced devices with features like automatic fall detection.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is a "care alert government rebate"?
This is a general term people use to describe the various government programs that help cover the cost of personal alarms. It's not a single program but refers to funding from My Aged Care, NDIS, DVA, or state schemes like PAV and PASA.

### Can I get a personal alarm completely free?
Yes, it is possible. In Victoria, the PAV program provides free systems to those who are eligible. In other states, you may be fully funded through a Level 4 Home Care Package or a comprehensive NDIS plan, effectively making the alarm free for you.

### What's the difference between a monitored and unmonitored alarm?
An **unmonitored** alarm will automatically call a list of pre-programmed numbers (e.g., family, friends) when activated. A **monitored** alarm connects to a 24/7 response center with trained operators who can assess the situation and call emergency services if needed. Most government-funded programs provide monitored alarms.

### Does the NDIS cover fall detection alarms?
Yes, the NDIS can fund alarms with automatic fall detection if it is considered "reasonable and necessary" for the participant's disability-related needs.
