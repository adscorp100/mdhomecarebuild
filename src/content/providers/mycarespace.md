# MyCareSpace

MyCareSpace simplifies your search for local NDIS providers, connecting you with verified support and therapy providers who have availability.

## About This Provider

MyCareSpace helps you spend your time on the things you love by taking care of your NDIS Provider search, connecting you with verified support and therapy providers with availability. Their free NDIS Navigators help connect you with verified local therapy providers who have availability or short waitlists.

The organization is part of the Access Care group, which creates organizations made up of exceptional people working together to deliver life-changing support for people living with a disability, their carers, and their families. Their goal is to make the NDIS an easier place to be - one that is less confusing to navigate and where people can take advantage of their funding opportunity to find the supports that will help them reach their goals.

## How MyCareSpace Works
