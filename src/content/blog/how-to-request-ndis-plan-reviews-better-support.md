# How to Request NDIS Plan Reviews and Get Better Support

## Key Points
- NDIS participants can request plan reviews at any time if their circumstances change or current supports are inadequate
- Successful plan reviews require clear evidence of changed needs, detailed documentation, and well-prepared justifications
- The review process typically takes 3-6 months from request to new plan implementation
- Proper preparation, including gathering evidence and setting clear goals, significantly improves review outcomes

## Understanding NDIS Plan Reviews

NDIS plan reviews are formal processes where the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) reassesses a participant's support needs and funding allocations. Unlike scheduled plan renewals that occur automatically, reviews can be requested by participants when circumstances change or when current supports prove inadequate.

### Types of NDIS Reviews

#### Scheduled Plan Reviews
- **Regular Reviews**: Standard plan reviews at the end of plan periods (typically 12-24 months)
- **Automatic Process**: Initiated by NDIA as plan expiry approaches
- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Full reassessment of all support needs and goals
- **Timeline**: Usually scheduled 3-4 months before plan expiry

#### Unscheduled Plan Reviews
- **Participant Requested**: Reviews initiated by participants due to changed circumstances
- **Immediate Need**: Reviews for urgent changes in support requirements
- **Circumstance-Based**: Triggered by significant life changes or events
- **Timeline**: Can be requested at any time during the plan period

#### Plan Reassessments
- **Detailed Reviews**: Comprehensive reassessment including new assessments and reports
- **Complex Changes**: For significant changes in disability, circumstances, or goals
- **Extended Process**: More thorough process involving multiple assessments
- **Timeline**: May take 6-12 months to complete

### When to Request a Plan Review

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often can I request a plan review?
You can request a plan review at any time if your circumstances have significantly changed since your last plan. However, the NDIA will only conduct reviews when there's genuine evidence of changed needs. Frequent review requests without substantial evidence of change may be declined. It's best to wait until you have clear evidence of changed circumstances and gather comprehensive documentation before requesting a review. Most successful reviews involve waiting at least 6-12 months between requests unless urgent circumstances arise.

### What evidence is most important for a successful plan review?
The most important evidence includes recent medical or allied health reports (within 6-12 months), functional capacity assessments, and detailed documentation of how your current supports are inadequate. Professional recommendations from occupational therapists, doctors, or other clinicians carry significant weight. Evidence should clearly demonstrate changed needs, document specific challenges you're facing, and show how additional or different supports would address these issues. Quantifiable evidence (like budget exhaustion rates or measurable functional changes) is particularly compelling.

### How long does the plan review process typically take?
Plan review timeframes vary significantly based on complexity. Simple reviews with clear evidence may take 6-8 weeks from request to new plan. More complex reviews requiring additional assessments typically take 3-6 months. Reviews involving high-cost supports or significant plan changes may take longer. Urgent reviews can sometimes be expedited, but this requires clear evidence of immediate risk or safety concerns. The NDIA should provide estimated timeframes when acknowledging your review request.

### Can I get support to help with my plan review?
Yes, several support options are available. Support coordinators can help prepare review requests, gather evidence, and attend planning meetings. Independent advocates can provide specialized assistance, particularly for complex reviews or if you've had difficulties with previous NDIA interactions. Local Area Coordinators (LACs) can provide some assistance, though their capacity may be limited. Family members or carers can also attend meetings and provide support. Consider your needs and the complexity of your review when deciding what level of support to access.

### What happens if my plan review is declined?
If your review is declined, the NDIA should provide clear reasons for the decision. You can request an internal review within 3 months if you disagree with the decision. Focus on addressing the specific reasons for decline by gathering additional evidence or clarifying information. Sometimes a decline indicates you need more comprehensive evidence or that your request needs to be restructured. You can also seek support from advocates or support coordinators to strengthen a future request. Consider whether the timing was appropriate and whether you had sufficient evidence to support your case.

### Can I request an urgent plan review for immediate needs?
Yes, urgent reviews are possible in circumstances involving immediate risk to health, safety, or wellbeing. Examples include sudden health deterioration, loss of informal supports, housing emergencies, or safety concerns. Urgent requests require clear evidence of immediate risk and documentation of why waiting for scheduled review would be harmful. Contact the NDIA immediately by phone rather than waiting for written processes. Have medical or professional evidence readily available to support the urgency of your request. Even urgent reviews require appropriate evidence, though processing may be expedited.
