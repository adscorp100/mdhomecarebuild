## How NDIS Support Worker Hourly Rates Are Set

NDIS hourly rates aren't arbitrary. They are determined by a combination of factors:

1.  **SCHADS Award:** The Social, Community, Home Care and Disability Services (SCHADS) Industry Award sets the minimum pay rates for disability support workers.
2.  **NDIS Price Guide:** The NDIS sets maximum prices that registered providers can charge. The 2025-26 guide includes the 3.95% increase to reflect wage inflation and the superannuation guarantee increase.
3.  **Qualifications & Experience:** Rates are tiered based on the worker's qualifications (e.g., Certificate III or IV) and level of experience.
4.  **Time of Day:** Evenings, nights, weekends, and public holidays command higher "penalty" rates.
5.  **Support Complexity:** High-intensity support for participants with complex needs requires more skilled workers and therefore has higher rates.
6.  **Location:** Remote and very remote areas have higher price limits (40-50% higher) to ensure services remain viable.

## Independent Support Worker Pay Rates

Independent support workers have the flexibility to set their own rates, but they also have to cover their own business costs.

- **Typical Hourly Rate:** Independent contractors usually charge **$55 - $65 per hour** for standard support.
- **Why the Higher Rate?** This rate needs to cover insurance, superannuation (11.5% as of July 2025), tax, training, and other business expenses.
- **New Rules for 2025:** As of July 1, 2025, independent support workers will need to be registered with the NDIS, which may add new compliance requirements.

If you're thinking of going independent, our guides on [becoming an independent support worker](/blog/guide-to-becoming-an-independent-support-worker/) and [getting the right insurance](/blog/how-to-get-support-worker-insurance-in-australia-a-2025-guide/) are essential reading.

## Rates for High-Intensity and Specialized Support

When a participant requires complex support, the hourly rates are higher.

-   **High-Intensity Support:** For participants with complex medical or behavioural needs. Rates can be **10-40% higher** than standard rates, depending on the level of skill required.
-   **Specialized Support:** This includes services like behaviour support or complex health support (e.g., wound care, catheter management). These roles require advanced training and command premium rates, often in the **$50 - $65 per hour** range even for weekdays.
