# Are You Getting the Most Out of Your Home Care Package?

You've been approved for a Home Care Package, but now you face the most important decision: choosing a provider to manage your funds.

Choosing the right provider is the difference between getting the bare minimum and living a full, supported life at home. Many providers charge high administration fees, take a cut from the services you need, and lock you into inflexible contracts, leaving you with less care and more frustration.

**At MD Home Care, we do things differently.** We believe your funds should be spent on your care, not on excessive fees.

## The MD Home Care Difference: More Care, Less Fees

We are a boutique, family-owned provider dedicated to offering {suburb} residents a better, more transparent choice. Here's how we make your funding go further:

### 1. Low, Transparent & All-Inclusive Fees
We charge one of the lowest and simplest fee structures in the industry.

*   **Low 15% Package Management Fee:** Covers everything from initial setup to ongoing support.
*   **No Hidden Costs:** We have no exit fees, no case management fees, and no additional charges for processing invoices or making changes.
*   **More Hours of Care:** Our low fees mean more of your funding goes directly to the care you need, often resulting in hours of extra support each week.

### 2. A Dedicated Local Care Manager
You will have a dedicated Care Manager based right here in {suburb}. They are your single point of contact, a trusted advisor who knows you and your needs personally. They will work with you to create a care plan that maximizes every dollar in your budget.

### 3. A Team of Exceptional, Vetted Carers
The quality of your care depends on the quality of your carer. We don't use contractors. All our support workers are directly employed, professionally trained, police-checked, and fully insured. We only hire compassionate, reliable people we would trust in our own homes.

> #### **"Switching to MD Home Care Was the Best Decision We Made."**
>
> "With our previous provider, we were losing nearly 40% of my father's package to 'management fees' and the level of care was inconsistent. We switched to MD Home Care, and the difference is night and day. Their fees are so much lower that Dad now gets an extra 4 hours of support a week, and his regular carer, Susan, is absolutely wonderful. We finally feel like we're getting the support Dad was approved for." - *Jessica R., {suburb}*

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What exactly is a "Package Management Fee"?**
This is a fee that providers charge to cover their administrative costs for managing your Home Care Package funds. Many providers have complex fee structures with multiple hidden charges. We keep it simple with one low, all-inclusive 15% fee.

**How do I know I can trust your carers?**
Our recruitment process is rigorous. Every carer is personally interviewed, reference-checked, and must pass a National Police Check and NDIS Worker Screening. They are our direct employees, and we invest in their ongoing training and support to ensure they provide the highest standard of care.

**Am I locked into a contract?**
No. We believe in earning your trust every day. You are not locked into a long-term contract, and we have no exit fees. Our focus is on providing exceptional service that makes you want to stay with us.
