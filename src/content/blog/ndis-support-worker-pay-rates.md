Navigating NDIS pay rates in 2025 can be confusing. With the recent Fair Work Commission wage increase and updates to the NDIS Price Guide, it's tough to know the official rates and how they affect a support worker's actual pay.

This guide simplifies everything. We'll explain the latest changes, break down the official NDIS rates, and provide specific details for Queensland and Victoria.

## NDIS Pay Rate Changes (July 2025)

As of 1 July 2025, the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits have been updated. This includes a **3.95% increase** to the price limits for supports delivered by disability support workers, reflecting the recent minimum wage increase.

These are the **maximum rates** a provider can charge for different types of support. They are not the minimum wage a support worker receives. A worker's actual pay is determined by the SCHADS Award and their employment agreement.

## National NDIS Pay Rates 2025

The following table shows the maximum hourly rates providers can charge under the NDIS Price Guide. These rates are national, but state-specific nuances are explained below.

| Support Item | Line Item Number | Weekday | Saturday | Sunday | Public Holiday |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard Support (Level 1)** | 04_107_0125_6_1 | **$67.56** | **$95.07** | **$122.79** | **$150.15** |
| **High Intensity Support (Level 2)** | 04_104_0125_6_1 | **$74.44** | **$105.46** | **$135.70** | **$165.95** |
| **Very High Intensity Support (Level 3)**| 04_105_0125_6_1 | **$75.82** | **$111.54** | **$143.51** | **$175.49** |
| **Night-Time Sleepover** | 04_120_0125_6_1 | **$287.13** | **$287.13** | **$287.13** | **$287.13** |

*Note: The rates above apply to TTP-registered providers. These are the maximum chargeable NDIS rates, not the employee's take-home wage.*

## NDIS Pay Rates in Queensland (QLD)

While the NDIS Price Guide is national, providers in Queensland must adhere to these maximum rates. The actual wage paid to a worker is based on the SCHADS Award.

**Example NDIS Rates Charged in QLD (per hour):**
- **Weekday Daytime:** $67.56
- **Weekday Evening:** $74.44
- **Saturday:** $95.07
- **Sunday:** $122.79

There are no major QLD-specific regulations that alter these NDIS price limits, but worker pay is subject to Queensland's industrial relations laws.

## NDIS Pay Rates in Victoria (VIC)

Similarly, the NDIS Price Guide sets the maximum chargeable rates in Victoria.

**Example NDIS Rates Charged in VIC (per hour):**
- **Weekday Daytime:** $67.56
- **Weekday Evening:** $74.44
- **Public Holiday:** A 150% loading on the base hourly rate is common.

Victoria follows the same national SCHADS Award for minimum employee wages.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the difference between the NDIS Price Guide and the SCHADS Award?
The **NDIS Price Guide** sets the *maximum price* a provider can charge for a service. The **SCHADS Award** sets the *minimum wage* a provider must pay their employee. A support worker's wage will always be lower than the NDIS price limit due to provider overheads like insurance, superannuation, and admin costs.

### How much do NDIS support workers get paid per hour?
A support worker's hourly wage depends on their employment contract and the SCHADS award level. As a general guide, casual workers might earn between **$30 - $45 per hour** for standard weekday work, with higher rates for evenings, weekends, and public holidays.

### Does the 3.95% increase apply directly to my wage?
Not automatically. The 3.95% increase applies to the maximum rate providers can charge. This gives providers more budget to potentially increase wages, but your pay is determined by your employment agreement, which must meet the minimums of the SCHADS Award.

### What is TTP?
TTP stands for **Temporary Transformation Payment**. It's a conditional loading on top of the standard price limit that eligible providers can charge to help them with costs associated with transitioning to the NDIS.

### What do the different support levels mean?
The levels reflect the complexity of support required:
-   **Level 1 (Standard):** For participants requiring standard support.
-   **Level 2 (High Intensity):** For participants with more complex needs.
-   **Level 3 (Very High Intensity):** For participants with the most complex needs, requiring highly skilled workers.

### How does travel pay work for NDIS support workers?
Providers can charge for the time a worker spends travelling to a participant, capped at 30 minutes in metro areas and 60 minutes in regional areas. The worker's pay for this travel time is determined by their employment contract.
