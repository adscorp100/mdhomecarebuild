## Introduction: Staying Informed About NDIS Changes

The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) continues to evolve, with significant changes rolling out throughout 2026 that affect how participants access supports, manage their plans, and work with providers. Whether you're a current NDIS participant, a family member supporting someone on the scheme, or considering applying for the first time, staying up-to-date with the latest NDIS news is essential for making the most of your funding and navigating the system effectively.

This comprehensive guide covers all the major NDIS updates and changes as of December 2026, explaining what they mean in practical terms and how you can adapt to ensure you continue receiving the support you need.

## Thriving Kids: The $4 Billion NDIS Alternative

The Australian Government unveiled the full model for **Thriving Kids** in February 2026, marking one of the most significant changes to early childhood disability support in a decade. This new program will provide services to children aged 8 and under with developmental delay or autism who have low to moderate support needs, outside of the NDIS.

**Key details about Thriving Kids:**

- **$4 billion in joint funding** over 5 years, split 50/50 between the Commonwealth and state/territory governments
- At least $1.4 billion of the Commonwealth's share will go directly to states for service delivery
- Services will be delivered in everyday settings like schools, childcare centres, and community locations
- **No formal diagnosis required** to access Thriving Kids, unlike the NDIS, which could save families significant time and money
- Supports will be goal-focused and time-limited, rather than ongoing annual plans

**Who stays on the NDIS?**

Children with **permanent and significant disability**, including those with developmental delay or autism who have substantially reduced functional capacity (high support needs), will continue to be eligible for the NDIS under the usual arrangements. Children already enrolled in the NDIS before 1 January 2028 will remain on the scheme.

**The four pillars of Thriving Kids:**

1. Early identification and awareness of developmental needs
2. Ready access to information, advice, and navigation support for parents
3. Building parenting skills and confidence
4. Timely access to targeted support from trained allied health professionals, including speech pathologists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, audiologists, and psychologists

**Timeline:**

- Services begin rolling out from **1 October 2026**
- Full implementation expected by **1 January 2028**
- Changes to NDIS access criteria for children under 9 will not take effect until January 2028, and will require amendments to the NDIS Act

The program was designed by the Thriving Kids Advisory Group, co-chaired by Professor Frank Oberklaid from the Murdoch Children's Research Institute. According to the [official government page](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/thriving-kids), the goal is to ensure children receive quality supports earlier in their developmental journey, when those supports can have the greatest impact.

**What families should know right now:**

If your child is currently on the NDIS, nothing changes immediately. Children already enrolled will stay on the scheme. The transition is gradual and legislative changes are still required before any NDIS access criteria change. If your child has high support needs, they will remain NDIS-eligible regardless of the new program.

For families who have been waiting for a diagnosis to access support, Thriving Kids may offer a faster pathway once it launches in October 2026.

### Growing Concerns About NDIS Plan Cuts

Alongside the Thriving Kids announcement, there are growing reports from NDIS participants and families about support reductions in existing plans. A [Guardian Australia investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/09/ndis-national-disability-insurance-scheme-changes-families-fear-cuts) published on 9 February 2026 documented families experiencing significant anxiety about plan cuts following the Getting the NDIS Back on Track legislation that commenced in October 2024.

Participants, advocates, and lawyers have reported that changes including new support definitions, funding caps for therapies, travel billing restrictions, and the introduction of funding periods have combined to reduce overall support for many participants.

The government has stated these changes are necessary to preserve the scheme for future generations, noting that without intervention, scheme expenses would have increased by $45 billion beyond projections.

If you have experienced unexpected reductions to your NDIS plan, you have the right to request an internal review of the decision. Consider seeking support from a disability advocate or your Support Coordinator before your plan reassessment.

## Major NDIS Changes in 2026: A Complete Overview

2026 has been a year of substantial reform for the NDIS. The government has introduced changes aimed at making the scheme more sustainable, fairer, and easier to navigate. Here's what's changed and what it means for you.

### The NDIS Support Lists Transition Has Ended

One of the most significant changes affecting participants is the end of the 12-month transition period for the NDIS Support Lists, which concluded on **2 October 2026**.

**What changed:**
- Since October 2024, the NDIA introduced formal Support Lists that clearly define what can and cannot be purchased with NDIS funding
- Supports are now separated into two categories: those that are NDIS supports (can be purchased) and those that are not (cannot be purchased)
- During the transition period, the NDIA didn't raise debts for first or second purchases of non-NDIS supports under $1,500

**What this means now:**
- From 3 October 2026, debts may be raised for any purchase that isn't on the approved NDIS supports list, regardless of the amount
- All claims must use updated support item codes, legacy item numbers are no longer accepted
- Participants should review their current supports to ensure everything aligns with the new lists

**Action required:** If you're unsure whether your supports comply with the new rules, speak with your Support Coordinator or Plan Manager. They can help check your supports and ensure your funding is used correctly.

### New NDIS Pricing Arrangements 2026-26

The NDIA released updated Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits that came into effect on **1 July 2026**, with additional updates from **24 November 2026**.

**Key pricing changes include:**

**Therapy Rate Adjustments:**
- Psychology and physiotherapy now have standardised national pricing, replacing the previous state-by-state system
- Psychology rates increased by approximately $10 in NSW, VIC, and QLD, while decreasing by around $11 in other states
- Physiotherapy prices decreased by $10 in eastern states, with larger reductions (up to 18%) elsewhere
- Dietetics and podiatry prices decreased by 2.6% nationally
- Art and music therapy rates changed to $156.16 per hour (down from $193.99) from 24 November 2026

**Core Support Increases:**
- Most core supports saw price increases of approximately 3.95%, reflecting the 3.5% wage increase and 0.5% superannuation increase

**Support Coordination Changes:**
- Level 1 Support Connection increased by 3.95%
- Level 2 and 3 Support Coordination price limits were frozen
- Plan Management monthly fees were frozen, and the one-off establishment fee was removed for new plans starting 1 July 2026

**Travel Billing Restrictions:**
- Therapists can now only bill travel time at 50% of their hourly rate
- Maximum billable travel time remains 30 minutes in metropolitan areas and 60 minutes in remote areas

### The New PACE System

If you've recently had a plan reassessment or are new to the NDIS, you're likely using the **PACE system** (Participant and Claims Enhancement). This is the NDIA's new computer system for managing plans.

**What's different with PACE:**

**Provider Endorsement:**
- Instead of creating individual service bookings, you now "endorse" providers through the portal
- You can add or remove endorsed providers at any time
- If you can't access the portal, your Support Coordinator, nominee, or the NDIS helpline (1800 800 110) can help

**Budget Display:**
- Your plan budget may appear differently in the portal
- Funding is now displayed according to the new support categories

### New Funding Periods

From **19 May 2026**, the NDIS introduced new funding periods, smaller, more regular payment cycles across the life of your plan.

**How it works:**
- Most funding periods are set to three months
- This helps participants manage their budget more consistently
- You won't receive access to your full annual budget all at once
- Changes are being rolled out gradually as participants receive new or reassessed plans

**Benefits:**
- Better budget management throughout your plan
- Reduced risk of running out of funds before your plan ends
- More flexibility to adjust spending as needed

### Impairment Notices From January 2026

From **1 January 2026**, all new NDIS participants receive an **impairment notice** instead of the previous access decision letter.

**What's included:**
- Confirmation of your access pathway (disability or early intervention)
- Your categories of impairment
- This information helps planners determine what supports are funded

**For existing participants:** You'll receive an impairment notice when you move to a new plan.

### Claims Deadline: Two-Year Rule

Since October 2024, all claims for payment must be submitted within **two years** of the support start date.

**What this means:**
- Keep closer track of invoices, receipts, and payment requests
- Don't delay submitting claims for services you've received
- Set up a system to track outstanding invoices

## Upcoming NDIS Changes: What's on the Horizon

### New Planning Framework (Mid-2026)

The NDIA originally planned to introduce a new planning process in September 2026 but has delayed implementation to **mid-2026** following feedback from the disability community.

**What we know:**
- The new approach is called "new framework planning"
- It aims to make planning fairer, more consistent, and easier for participants
- A new needs assessment tool called **I-CAN** (Instrument for Classification and Assessment of Support Needs) will be used for participants aged 16 and over
- Changes will be rolled out gradually

### NDIS Amendment (Integrity and Safeguarding) Bill 2026

On 11 November 2026, Minister McAllister announced the second tranche of legislative reforms to the NDIS. These changes focus on improving the quality of care and safety for all NDIS participants.

### Early Childhood Approach Expansion

The early childhood approach now covers children up to **9 years old** (previously 7 years old), providing earlier intervention support for more young Australians with developmental delays or disabilities.

## NDIS Financial Update: Scheme Sustainability

The NDIS Quarterly Report (March 2026) shows positive progress on scheme sustainability:

- Scheme expenses for the first nine months of 2024-25 were $34.2 billion, $740 million lower than projected
- Annual cost growth at the end of March was 10.6%
- The scheme is on track to achieve the financial stabilisation target of 8% growth by 1 July 2026

The pricing adjustments throughout 2026, particularly for therapies, are part of broader efforts to ensure participants are charged fairly and consistently with what other Australians pay through Medicare or Private Health Insurance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the biggest NDIS change in 2026?

The launch of the **Thriving Kids** program is arguably the most significant NDIS-related change in 2026. This $4 billion initiative will move children under 9 with low to moderate developmental needs off the NDIS and into a new support system starting October 2026. The end of the Support Lists transition period on 2 October 2026 is also a major change, as the NDIA can now raise debts for purchases that aren't approved NDIS supports.

### Are NDIS prices going up or down in 2026-26?

It depends on the service. Core supports increased by approximately 3.95%, while many therapy services saw price reductions as part of efforts to align NDIS pricing with Medicare rates. Art and music therapy rates decreased from $193.99 to $156.16 per hour.

### What is the PACE system?

PACE (Participant and Claims Enhancement) is the NDIA's new computer system for managing NDIS plans. It introduces changes like provider endorsement (instead of service bookings) and displays budgets according to updated support categories.

### When is the new NDIS planning framework starting?

The new planning framework is now expected to begin in mid-2026, delayed from the original September 2026 date. It will include a new needs assessment tool called I-CAN for participants aged 16 and over.

### Can I still use my NDIS funding for the same things?

You must ensure your purchases align with the official NDIS Support Lists. If you've been buying items that aren't on the approved list, you may need to find alternative supports or discuss the replacement support rule with your planner.

### Will my child lose their NDIS access because of Thriving Kids?

Not immediately. Children already enrolled in the NDIS will remain on the scheme. Changes to NDIS access criteria for children under 9 with developmental delay or autism (low to moderate needs) will not take effect until 1 January 2028, and will require legislative amendments. Children with high support needs or permanent and significant disability will continue to be NDIS-eligible.

### What should I do if I'm confused about the changes?

Contact your Support Coordinator, Plan Manager, or a trusted directory like MD Home Care. They can review your plan, explain how changes affect you, and help you adjust your supports accordingly.

## Conclusion: Staying Ahead of NDIS Changes

The NDIS landscape continues to shift as the scheme matures and responds to sustainability challenges. While change can feel overwhelming, staying informed empowers you to make the most of your funding and advocate for the supports you need.

The key changes to remember:
- **Thriving Kids launches October 2026**, offering a new pathway for children under 9 with low to moderate developmental needs
