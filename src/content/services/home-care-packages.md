# Are You Getting the Most Out of Your Home Care Package?

You've been approved for a Home Care Package, but now you face the most important decision: choosing a provider to manage your funds.

Choosing the right provider is the difference between getting the bare minimum and living a full, supported life at home. Many providers charge high administration fees, take a cut from the services you need, and lock you into inflexible contracts, leaving you with less care and more frustration.

**Find providers through MD Home Care who do things differently.** These providers believe your funds should be spent on your care, not on excessive fees.

*   **Low Package Management Fees:** Covering everything from initial setup to ongoing support.
*   **No Hidden Costs:** Many have no exit fees, no case management fees, and no additional charges for processing invoices or making changes.
*   **More Hours of Care:** Low fees mean more of your funding goes directly to the care you need, often resulting in hours of extra support each week.

### 2. A Dedicated Local Care Manager

> #### **"Switching to MD Home Care Was the Best Decision We Made."**
>
> "With our previous provider, we were losing nearly 40% of my father's package to 'management fees' and the level of care was inconsistent. We switched to MD Home Care, and the difference is night and day. Their fees are so much lower that Dad now gets an extra 4 hours of support a week, and his regular carer, Susan, is absolutely wonderful. We finally feel like we're getting the support Dad was approved for." - *Jessica R., {suburb}*
