## What is a Reportable Incident?

A reportable incident is any event that occurs in connection with NDIS supports and services that:
- Results in harm (or risk of harm) to an NDIS participant
- Involves specific types of serious events defined in the NDIS Act
- Must be reported to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission

Under **Section 73Z(4) of the NDIS Act**, registered providers have a legal obligation to report certain incidents that occur during the delivery of NDIS-funded supports.

### Key Principle: When in Doubt, Report

The NDIS Commission takes a risk-averse approach. If you're unsure whether an incident is reportable, it's better to report and let the Commission determine its significance than to fail to report a serious incident.

---

## Types of Reportable Incidents

The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission requires reporting of these six categories:

### 1. Death of a Participant

**What to report:**
- Any death of an NDIS participant that occurs in connection with NDIS supports
- Deaths from natural causes if they occurred during service delivery
- Unexpected or accidental deaths
- Deaths where abuse, neglect, or provider actions may have contributed

**Examples:**
- Participant passes away during an overnight respite stay
- Participant dies following a fall while receiving personal care
- Participant dies from a medical emergency while with a support worker

### 2. Serious Injury

**What to report:**
- Any injury requiring hospitalisation or emergency medical treatment
- Injuries creating significant risk of death or permanent impairment
- Fractures, severe burns, head injuries, loss of consciousness
- Injuries from falls, accidents, or incidents during service delivery

**Examples:**
- Participant fractures hip during a transfer
- Participant suffers burns while cooking with support worker assistance
- Participant has a seizure and hits their head, requiring hospital visit

### 3. Abuse

**What to report:**
- **Physical abuse:** Hitting, pushing, rough handling, inappropriate physical force
- **Emotional/psychological abuse:** Threats, intimidation, humiliation, verbal abuse
- **Financial abuse:** Theft, coercion to give money, misuse of participant funds
- **Sexual abuse:** Any non-consensual sexual contact or exploitation

**Examples:**
- Support worker yells at and intimidates a participant
- Family member pressures participant to hand over NDIS funds
- Worker physically restrains participant without authorisation

### 4. Neglect

**What to report:**
- Failure to provide adequate food, water, clothing, or shelter
- Failure to provide necessary medical care or medication
- Failure to ensure participant safety
- Leaving a participant unattended when supervision is required

**Examples:**
- Participant not given prescribed medication for multiple days
- Participant left alone overnight when 24-hour support is funded
- Participant's hygiene needs ignored, leading to health issues

### 5. Unlawful Sexual or Physical Contact

**What to report:**
- Any sexual assault or non-consensual sexual contact
- Physical assault (hitting, kicking, pushing)
- Sexual misconduct (inappropriate comments, exposure, harassment)
- Any criminal conduct involving physical or sexual harm

**Examples:**
- Support worker makes sexual advances toward participant
- Participant assaulted by another resident in group home
- Worker uses excessive force during personal care

### 6. Unauthorised Restrictive Practices

**What to report:**
- Use of any restrictive practice without proper authorisation
- Restrictive practices not included in the participant's behaviour support plan
- Practices used outside approved conditions or timeframes

**Types of restrictive practices:**
| Practice | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **Seclusion** | Confining a person alone in a room they cannot leave |
| **Chemical restraint** | Using medication to control behaviour (not treat a condition) |
| **Mechanical restraint** | Using devices to restrict movement (e.g., straps, belts) |
| **Physical restraint** | Using body contact to restrict movement |
| **Environmental restraint** | Restricting access to areas or items |

**Examples:**

## How to Report Incidents: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Secure the Scene and Ensure Safety

Before reporting, take immediate action to:
- Ensure the participant is safe and receiving any needed medical care

## Who Must Report: Mandatory Reporters

### Registered NDIS Providers

All registered providers have a legal obligation to report, including:
- Organisations (companies, incorporated associations)
- Sole traders
- Community groups
- Subcontractors providing NDIS services

### NDIS Workers and Staff

All workers must notify their employer immediately upon becoming aware of an incident:
- Permanent employees
- Casual staff
- Volunteers
- Contractors and subcontractors
- Agency staff

**Note:** The worker notifies the provider; the provider submits the report to the Commission.

### Support Coordinators and Plan Managers

These roles have the same reporting obligations when incidents occur during their service delivery.

### Who is NOT a Mandatory Reporter?

- Participants themselves (but can and should report concerns)
- Family members and carers (but should report to providers)
- Unregistered providers (different rules apply)

---

## Common Scenarios: What to Report

Based on real questions from NDIS providers, here's guidance on common scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Participant Falls During Transfer

**Situation:** A participant fell while being transferred from wheelchair to bed. They have a small bruise but no serious injury.

**Is it reportable?** Potentially YES if:
- The fall was caused by worker error or inadequate equipment
- The participant requires medical attention
- There's any risk the injury could worsen

**Action:** If in doubt, report. Document thoroughly and monitor for delayed symptoms.

### Scenario 2: Medication Error Caught Before Administration

**Situation:** A support worker prepared the wrong medication dose but caught the error before giving it to the participant.

**Is it reportable?** NO - this is a "near-miss"

**Action:** Record internally in your incident management system. Review procedures to prevent recurrence. Not required to report to Commission.

### Scenario 3: Participant Assaulted by Stranger During Community Access

**Situation:** While on a community outing with a support worker, a participant was pushed by a stranger. No serious injury.

**Is it reportable?** YES - the incident occurred during NDIS-funded support delivery.

**Action:** Report within 24 hours. Note that the perpetrator was not connected to the provider.

### Scenario 4: Verbal Abuse from Participant Toward Worker

**Situation:** A participant shouted abuse and made threats toward their support worker.

**Is it reportable?** NO - incidents must involve harm to participants, not workers.

**Action:** Record internally. Follow workplace health and safety procedures. Consider whether the participant needs additional behavioural support.

### Scenario 5: Participant Self-Harms During Service

**Situation:** A support worker witnessed a participant self-harming during a session. The participant was taken to hospital.

**Is it reportable?** YES - the incident occurred during NDIS-funded support and resulted in hospitalisation.

**Action:** Report within 24 hours. Coordinate with mental health services. Review participant's support plan.

### Scenario 6: Historical Abuse Disclosed

**Situation:** A participant tells their support worker about abuse that happened years ago with a different provider.

**Is it reportable?** The current provider should report if:
- The alleged perpetrator still works in the NDIS sector
- The participant consents to a report being made
- There's an ongoing risk to any participant

**Action:** Support the participant to make their own report or, with consent, report on their behalf. Connect with advocacy services.

### Quick Reference: Report or Record?

| Scenario | Report to Commission | Record Internally |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Death during service | YES (24 hours) | YES |
| Hospitalisation from injury | YES (24 hours) | YES |
| Minor bruise from fall | ASSESS - likely YES | YES |
| Near-miss (no harm) | NO | YES |
| Medication error (no harm) | NO | YES |
| Abuse/neglect allegation | YES (24 hours) | YES |
| Verbal abuse TO worker | NO | YES |
| Unauthorised restraint | YES (24 hours) | YES |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the deadline for reporting NDIS incidents?

You must submit an Immediate Notification within 24 hours of becoming aware of a reportable incident. A detailed 5-Day Report must follow within 5 business days. These are strict deadlines - late reports require written explanation.

### Do I need participant consent to report an incident?

No. Mandatory reporting obligations override consent requirements for reportable incidents. You must report even if the participant does not want you to. However, you should explain why you're reporting and support the participant through the process.

### What happens after I submit a report?

The Commission will acknowledge receipt and may contact you for additional information. They assess the incident and may take actions including investigation, compliance monitoring, or participant safeguarding. You may be required to provide updates on corrective actions.

### Are near-misses reportable?

No. Near-misses (incidents that could have caused harm but didn't) are not reportable to the Commission. However, they must be recorded in your internal incident management system and reviewed to prevent future incidents.

### What if I'm not sure whether to report?

When in doubt, report. The Commission prefers over-reporting to under-reporting. You can note in your report that you're unsure if it meets the threshold. There's no penalty for reporting incidents that turn out not to be serious.

### Can I be penalised for reporting?

No. The NDIS Act protects people who report incidents in good faith. Providers cannot take adverse action against workers who report incidents. If you experience retaliation, contact the Commission.

### What if the incident involves a worker from another provider?

Report the incident to the Commission and note that the alleged perpetrator works for a different provider. The Commission will coordinate any cross-provider investigation.

### Do unregistered providers have to report?

Unregistered providers have different obligations. They must still maintain safe practices and can be subject to complaints. If you're unsure about your obligations, contact the Commission directly.

### How long must I keep incident records?

Maintain all incident records for a minimum of 7 years. This includes reports submitted to the Commission, internal documentation, investigation notes, and corrective action records.

### What support is available for participants after an incident?

Connect participants with:
- NDIS advocacy services
- Counselling and mental health support
- Independent support coordination
- The Commission's complaints process if they're unhappy with how the incident was handled
