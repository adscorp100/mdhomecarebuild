> **Important Update:** As of November 1, 2025, the Support at Home program replaced Home Care Packages. If you're searching for "Level 4 Home Care Package," you now need **Support at Home Classification 7 or 8** for high-level care needs.

The Support at Home program provides up to **$78,000** in annual funding for older Australians with complex, high-level care needs (Classification 8). For families navigating this stage, high-level Support at Home funding remains a lifeline, enabling loved ones to remain safely at home.

This guide covers the new Support at Home classifications for high-level care, what services are covered, and how to find the right provider.

## Who is a Level 4 Package For?

> **Check Your Care Level:** Take our free [ACAT Assessment Level Quiz](/tools/acat-level-quiz) to estimate which Home Care Package level matches your care needs.

A Level 4 Home Care Package is for individuals who have been assessed by an Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) as having **high-level or complex care needs**. This typically includes those who:
- Require comprehensive and coordinated services.
- Need assistance with a wide range of daily activities.
- Have complex health conditions requiring clinical or nursing support.
- Might otherwise need to consider moving into a residential aged care facility.

## Funding: How Much Do I Get in 2025?

Under the new Support at Home program, high-level care funding is:

| Classification | Annual Budget | Quarterly Budget |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| Classification 7 | ~$61,000 | ~$15,250 |
| Classification 8 | ~$78,000 | ~$19,500 |

**Key changes from the old system:**
- Budgets are now paid **quarterly** and held by Services Australia
- You can roll over up to **$1,000 or 10%** of your quarterly budget
- Care management fees are **capped at 10%**

## How Many Hours of Care Does That Provide?

The funding for a Level 4 package translates to approximately **20-28 hours of care per fortnight**.

This figure can vary based on the provider's fees and the mix of services you choose. For example, specialized nursing care costs more per hour than domestic assistance, which will affect the total hours you can receive. Choosing a provider with low administrative fees is key to maximizing your care hours.

**Calculate your hours:** Use our free **[Home Care Package Calculator](/tools/home-care-package-calculator)** to estimate how many hours of care you'll receive based on your provider's rates.

## What Services Can I Access?

A Level 4 package is designed to fund a comprehensive range of services, with a strong focus on clinical support to manage complex health needs.

### Specialized Clinical & Nursing Services
- **Complex Wound Care:** Management of chronic or complex wounds by trained nurses.
- **Continence Management:** Development and supervision of a personalized continence plan.
- **Medication Management:** For complex medication schedules.
- **Palliative Care Support:** End-of-life care and symptom management at home.
- **Post-Hospitalization Care:** High-level support and rehabilitation after a hospital stay.
- **Chronic Disease Management:** Nursing support for conditions like diabetes, heart failure, or dementia.

### Home Modifications & Assistive Technology
- **Major Bathroom Modifications:** Installing walk-in showers or accessible toilets.
- **Stair Lifts:** To allow safe access to different levels of the home.
- **Ramps and Handrails:** For improved mobility and safety.
- **Specialized Mobility Aids:** Funding towards wheelchairs or other complex mobility equipment.

## Checklist for Choosing a Level 4 Provider

Selecting a provider for high-level care is a critical decision. Your provider must have proven experience in managing complex needs. Use this checklist when interviewing them:

- **Complex Care Experience:** "Can you provide examples of how you've managed care for clients with needs similar to mine?"
- **24/7 Support:** "What are your procedures for after-hours emergencies, and what on-call support is available?"
- **Clinical Governance:** "How do you ensure your nursing and clinical services meet the highest safety and quality standards?"
- **Managing Transitions:** "What is your experience in supporting clients who may eventually transition to residential care?"
- **Staff Qualifications:** "What specific training and qualifications do your staff have for high-level and palliative care?"

## The Transition to Residential Care

For many families, a Level 4 package is a crucial tool for delaying the move to residential care. However, it can also be used to support a safe and dignified transition when the time is right.

Community forums show that the "tipping point" for families often involves caregiver burnout or a decline in the person's health that makes staying at home unsafe, even with significant support.

A Level 4 package can be used to:
- **Fund Respite Care:** Giving primary caregivers a much-needed break.
- **Support Transition Planning:** Funding consultations and assessments to ensure a smooth move.
- **Coordinate Care:** Your provider can liaise with the residential facility to ensure a seamless handover of care.

## Support at Home vs. NDIS

It's important to understand the difference between these two government programs:
- **Support at Home:** For older Australians, generally **age 65 and over** (replaced Home Care Packages in November 2025).
- **National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS):** For Australians with a significant and permanent disability, **under the age of 65**.

**Not sure which program is right for you?** Take our free **[HCP vs NDIS Comparison Quiz](/tools/hcp-vs-ndis)** to find out which funding program suits your situation.

You cannot receive funding from both programs at the same time. The key factor is your age at the time of application.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the main difference between a Level 3 and a Level 4 package?
The primary difference is the level of care and funding. A Level 3 package is for intermediate needs ($40,945.70 subsidy), while a Level 4 package is for high and complex needs ($79,473 subsidy) and includes funding for more intensive clinical and nursing support.

### Can a Level 4 package cover 24-hour care?
No. While a Level 4 package provides substantial support, the funding is not sufficient to cover 24/7 care. It is designed to provide a high level of support to allow someone to remain at home, often with the help of family caregivers.

### What happens to the package funds if the person passes away?
Any unspent funds in the Home Care Package, after all provider fees have been paid, are returned to the government and the individual's estate.
