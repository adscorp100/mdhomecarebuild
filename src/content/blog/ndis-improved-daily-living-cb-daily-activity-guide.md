NDIS Improved Daily Living (also called CB Daily Activity) is one of the most valuable funding categories in your NDIS plan. It funds therapies, assessments, and training to help you build skills and independence. However, understanding what it covers, the line item codes, and current pricing can be confusing.

This comprehensive guide explains everything about Category 15 funding in 2026: what services you can access, how much they cost, the specific line item codes providers use, and strategies to maximise your Capacity Building budget.

## What is CB Daily Activity in Your NDIS Plan?

CB Daily Activity is the term you'll see in your NDIS portal for what's officially called "Improved Daily Living" in your plan documents. This Capacity Building category (Category 15) funds therapies and training that help you build skills for greater independence.

### CB Daily Activity vs Improved Daily Living: Are They Different?

No - CB Daily Activity and Improved Daily Living are exactly the same thing. The NDIS uses both terms interchangeably across different systems, which can be confusing. "CB Daily Activity" appears in the myplace portal, while "Improved Daily Living" is used in official plan documents and the NDIS Support Catalogue. Understanding this helps you navigate your plan and find the right supports.

## Quick Reference: Improved Daily Living at a Glance

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Budget Type** | Capacity Building (not Core) |
| **Support Category** | Category 15 |
| **Also Known As** | CB Daily Activity, Improved Daily Living Skills |
| **Main Purpose** | Build skills and independence through therapy and training |
| **Funding Flexibility** | Flexible within category (PACE plans), stated in older plans |
| **Key Providers** | OTs, Psychologists, Speech Pathologists, Physiotherapists |

## What is NDIS Improved Daily Living (CB Daily Activity)?

Improved Daily Living is a Capacity Building support category (Category 15) that funds assessment, training, and therapy to help you develop skills for greater independence. The "CB" in CB Daily Activity stands for "Capacity Building."

### Why Two Names?

You'll see both terms used:
- **"Improved Daily Living"** - Used in NDIS plans and the Support Catalogue
- **"CB Daily Activity"** - Used in the NDIS portal and myplace system

They're the same thing. The NDIS PACE system is gradually standardising terminology to reduce this confusion.

### What Makes It Different from Core Supports?

| Feature | Improved Daily Living (Capacity Building) | Assistance with Daily Life (Core) |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Build skills for future independence | Help with current daily tasks |
| **Focus** | Learning and developing | Doing and managing |
| **Example** | OT teaches you strategies to cook independently | Support worker helps prepare your meals |
| **Outcome** | Reduced need for support over time | Ongoing assistance as needed |

**Key distinction:** A support worker helping you shower uses Core funding. An OT teaching you strategies to shower independently uses Improved Daily Living funding.   

## What Exactly is NDIS Improved Daily Living / CB Daily Activity?

Formally, Improved Daily Living (often abbreviated in the NDIS portal as CB Daily Activity) is a support category within the NDIS Capacity Building budget. It provides funding specifically for assessment, training, or therapy aimed at helping participants increase their skills, independence, and participation in their community. The "CB" in "CB Daily Activity" simply stands for Capacity Building, reinforcing its purpose.   

Historically, the term "Improved Daily Living Skills" was predominantly used in NDIS plans and the official NDIS Support Catalogue (the detailed list of NDIS supports and their prices). Conversely, the NDIS participant and provider portals often used the abbreviation "CB Daily Activity" to refer to the same budget category. This discrepancy could lead to confusion when participants compared their plan documents to the information displayed in the online portals. The introduction of the NDIS PACE system is intended to resolve such inconsistencies, promoting clearer and more uniform language across the scheme. Additionally, the NDIA released a new [Operational Guideline for Therapy Supports](https://www.ndis.gov.au/about-us/operational-guidelines/supports-funded-ndis) alongside the November 2025 PAPL v1.1 update, clarifying what therapy supports are funded and how providers should deliver and claim for them.   

Within the NDIS framework, Improved Daily Living sits firmly under the Capacity Building budget type. It corresponds to Support Category 15 in the NDIS Support Catalogue, which lists all specific support items and their unique codes.   

The core philosophy behind this category is proactive development. It's about equipping participants with the abilities and strategies needed to live more autonomously and engage more fully with the world around them. This focus on skill-building aims not only to enhance the participant's quality of life but also potentially to reduce their reliance on other forms of support over the long term. This outcome benefits the participant through increased independence and contributes to the overall sustainability of the NDIS by fostering self-reliance. The category primarily covers therapies and training for individuals aged 7 and over, while also encompassing specialised early childhood supports designed to build foundational skills for children under this age (or under 9 during the current transition). The approach is holistic, recognising that improving daily living involves both therapeutic interventions and the acquisition of practical, real-world skills like budgeting or using public transport.   

## Capacity Building vs. Core Supports: Knowing Your Budgets

Understanding the distinction between the NDIS Capacity Building and Core Supports budgets is fundamental to effectively utilising an NDIS plan. While both are designed to support participants, they serve different primary purposes and operate under different rules, particularly concerning funding flexibility.

Core Supports are primarily focused on enabling participants to manage their everyday activities and meet their current, ongoing disability-related needs. This budget helps participants 'do' the things required in daily life. Examples include funding for support workers to assist with personal care (showering, dressing), help with household tasks (cleaning, gardening), assistance to participate in community activities, purchasing everyday consumables (like continence aids), or transport assistance.   

Capacity Building Supports, including Improved Daily Living, are designed to help participants build their skills and independence for the future. The focus is on 'learning' and 'developing' capabilities that can lead to greater autonomy and reduced need for support over time. Examples include funding for various therapies (like Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Psychology), specific training programs (like learning to use public transport or manage a budget), or support coordination to help manage the plan.   

A key difference lies in funding flexibility. The Core Supports budget is generally considered flexible. This means that funding allocated within the Core budget can often be used across its different support categories (e.g., funds allocated for consumables might be used for assistance with daily life, or vice versa), provided the spending aligns with the participant's goals and meets the NDIS reasonable and necessary criteria. This flexibility allows participants to adapt their spending to meet fluctuating daily needs.   

Conversely, the Capacity Building budget is generally stated or fixed at the category level. This means funding allocated to one Capacity Building category (e.g., Improved Daily Living) cannot typically be moved to another Capacity Building category (e.g., Finding and Keeping a Job) or to the Core or Capital budgets. However, within the Improved Daily Living category itself, there is often significant flexibility, especially under the newer PACE plans. Participants can usually choose which specific therapies or training supports within that category they wish to access, as long as it aligns with their plan goals. Older NDIS plans might contain 'stated supports' within this category, restricting funding to a specific type of therapy (e.g., "$5,000 for Physiotherapy"), limiting this internal flexibility.   

This difference in flexibility rules highlights the need for distinct planning approaches. The adaptability of the Core budget caters to variable day-to-day requirements, while the structure of the Capacity Building budget necessitates more deliberate planning during plan development, ensuring that allocated funds are clearly linked to specific skill-building goals within each category.   

The following table summarises the key distinctions:

| Feature | Core Supports Budget | Capacity Building Supports Budget |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| Primary Purpose | Assist with everyday activities & current needs | Build skills & independence for the future |
| Focus | Doing/Managing daily life | Learning/Developing skills |
| Funding Flexibility (Between Categories) | Generally Flexible (within Core budget) | Generally Stated (cannot move between CB categories) |
| Funding Flexibility (Within Category) | Flexible | Flexible within the category (esp. PACE), unless 'stated' |
| Examples | Personal care, transport, consumables, access support | Therapy (OT, Physio, Psych), skill training, Support Coord. |

It is particularly important to distinguish Improved Daily Living (Capacity Building) from Assistance with Daily Life (Core). While both relate to daily activities, their purpose is different.   

Assistance with Daily Life (Core): Funds supports where someone helps the participant perform a task. Example: Paying a support worker to assist with showering or to clean the participant's home.   

Improved Daily Living (Capacity Building): Funds supports where a professional teaches the participant skills or strategies to perform a task more independently. Example: Paying an Occupational Therapist to teach strategies for independent showering or develop a system for managing household tasks.   

This distinction can sometimes be unclear, emphasizing the need for participants, support coordinators, and providers to communicate clearly about whether a support is intended to provide direct assistance (Core) or to build skills (Capacity Building). Ensuring alignment between the support's purpose and the correct funding category is crucial for effective plan implementation and achieving desired outcomes.   

## Unlocking Potential: What Can Improved Daily Living Funding Be Used For?

The Improved Daily Living (CB Daily Activity) category offers a broad spectrum of supports designed to enhance a participant's functional capacity, independence, and community engagement. The funding covers assessment, training, therapy, and specific capacity-building services, which can be delivered either individually or in group settings.   

The sheer variety of available supports allows for highly personalized plans tailored to individual needs and goals. This flexibility within the category means participants can combine different therapies and training programs to create a support package that best addresses their specific challenges and aspirations.   

Here is a detailed breakdown of common supports funded under this category:

**Calculate your therapy sessions:** Use our free **[NDIS Therapy Hours Calculator](/tools/ndis-therapy-calculator)** to estimate how many OT, physio, psychology, and speech sessions you can get with your CB Daily Activities budget.

### 1. Therapeutic Supports & Assessments:
This is often the largest component, involving allied health professionals working directly with participants to assess needs and deliver interventions:

Occupational Therapy (OT): Focuses on improving participation in daily activities (occupations). This includes functional assessments, developing skills for tasks like dressing, cooking, personal care, fine motor control, recommending assistive technology, and suggesting home modifications related to skill-building.   

Psychology: Provides therapy aimed at building capacity related to the impact of a disability. This might involve developing emotional regulation strategies (e.g., for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder - ASD), learning coping mechanisms for disability-related stress, or improving social interaction skills impacted by the disability. It's important to note this is distinct from treatment for primary mental health conditions, which typically falls under the mainstream health system. Careful justification linking the psychology support to specific disability-related capacity building goals is often required.   

Physiotherapy: Aims to improve movement and physical function, including mobility, strength, balance, and coordination, enabling greater participation in daily life.   

Speech Therapy (Speech Pathology): Addresses communication challenges (speech, language, comprehension, social communication) and can also assist with swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) that impact eating and drinking safely.   

Exercise Physiology: Involves designing and delivering tailored exercise programs to manage the functional impact of a disability, improve fitness, endurance, and overall capacity for daily tasks.   

Dietetics: Provides nutritional assessment and advice specifically related to disability needs that affect health, well-being, and the ability to participate in daily activities (e.g., managing dietary requirements for specific conditions, advice for texture-modified diets).   

Counselling: Offers support related to adjusting to disability, building resilience, developing coping strategies, and managing the psychosocial impacts of disability on daily life.   

Social Work: Can provide capacity-building support in areas like navigating complex service systems, developing support networks, planning for life transitions, and enhancing problem-solving skills.   

Developmental Education: Focuses on practical skill development for individuals with developmental or intellectual disabilities, promoting independence in daily living, learning, and community participation.   

Audiology, Podiatry, Orthoptics: Provide assessments and therapies related to hearing, foot care, and vision where these impact daily functioning due to disability.   

Therapy Assistants: Work under the supervision of qualified therapists to help participants practice skills and implement therapy programs. They are distinct from general support workers who provide direct assistance.   

Art Therapy / Music Therapy: Utilise creative mediums as therapeutic tools to help participants achieve goals related to emotional expression, communication, motor skills, and cognitive function.   

### 2. Skill Development & Training:
This focuses on teaching practical skills for greater independence:

General Skill Development: Covers a wide range of practical life skills training. Examples include participating in cooking workshops to learn meal preparation, money management training for budgeting and financial literacy, time management coaching, and learning effective household chore routines.   

Public Transport Training: Specific training to learn how to navigate buses, trains, or trams independently and safely.   

Assistance with Decision Making, Daily Planning, Budgeting: Targeted support to develop executive functioning skills crucial for managing daily life.   

Training for Parents/Carers: Equipping family members or carers with strategies and knowledge to support the participant's skill development and reinforce learning in everyday environments. This acknowledges the vital role of the support network in achieving lasting outcomes.   

Driving Lessons/Specialised Training: Funding may be available for driving lessons if obtaining a license is directly linked to achieving independence goals impacted by disability. This can also include specialised training needed to operate vehicle modifications.   

Technology Skills Workshops: Training to improve digital literacy, enabling participants to use computers, tablets, or smartphones for communication, accessing information, or managing daily tasks.   

### 3. Other Capacity-Building Supports:

Specialised/Wearable Technology: Funding may cover technology specifically designed to build capacity in daily activities, distinct from general assistive technology funded under the Capital budget. Justification must clearly link the technology to skill development.   

### 4. Early Childhood Intervention:
For children younger than 7 (or younger than 9 under the phased rollout), this category funds early intervention supports. These are evidence-based therapies and programs designed to help young children with developmental delay or disability build foundational skills essential for learning, participation, and future independence. From 1 January 2028, children with low to moderate support needs may receive these supports through the new [Thriving Kids program](/blog/ndis-news-latest-updates-australia#thriving-kids-the-4-billion-ndis-alternative) rather than through NDIS plans.   

The potential for overlap between supports funded here and those covered by mainstream services (like health or education) or other NDIS budgets (like Capital Assistive Technology) necessitates careful planning. Goals must be clearly defined, and justifications must explicitly link the requested support to building capacity related to the participant's disability within the scope of the Improved Daily Living category.

## CB Daily Activity Examples by Disability Type

Different disabilities require different approaches to capacity building. Here are common CB Daily Activity supports tailored to specific disability types:

### For Participants with Autism Spectrum Disorder

- **Occupational Therapy** for sensory regulation strategies and daily routine management

- **Occupational Therapy** assessments for adaptive equipment recommendations
- **Exercise physiology** for building functional capacity and endurance
- **Skills training** for learning to use mobility aids and assistive technology

### For Participants with Intellectual Disabilities

- **Developmental education** for money management and budgeting skills
- **Public transport training** to build travel independence
- **Occupational Therapy** for daily living skills like cooking and personal care
- **Speech pathology** for communication strategies and social skills development

### For Participants with Psychosocial Disabilities

- **Psychology** for coping strategies and symptom management
- **Occupational Therapy** for establishing daily routines and structure
- **Social work** for navigating systems and building support networks
- **Counselling** for resilience building and adjustment support

## Making the Most of Your Funding: Rules, Flexibility & Costs

Effectively utilising Improved Daily Living funding requires understanding the specific rules around flexibility, pricing, and associated costs like travel and cancellations. These rules ensure funds are used appropriately and provide transparency for both participants and providers.

### Funding Flexibility Rules:
The flexibility of how Improved Daily Living funds can be spent depends largely on the type of NDIS plan:

PACE Plans: The NDIS PACE system, being progressively rolled out, generally offers greater flexibility. Funding allocated to the Improved Daily Living category in a PACE plan can typically be used for any eligible support within that category (as listed in the NDIS Support Catalogue), provided it aligns with the participant's goals. For instance, a participant with $10,000 in this category aiming to manage anxiety could choose to spend it entirely on Psychology, entirely on Occupational Therapy (if justified for anxiety management), or on a combination of eligible therapies like Counselling or Social Work. This empowers participants to choose the supports they feel will be most effective, but also places greater responsibility on them (or their support network/coordinator) to understand the category's scope and make informed decisions.   

Older (Non-PACE) Plans: Plans created before the PACE rollout may contain 'stated supports'. In this case, the plan might specify exactly which therapy the funding is for (e.g., "$8,000 for Speech Pathology"). If supports are stated, the funding must be used for that specific purpose and cannot be redirected to other therapies within the Improved Daily Living category.   

General Rule (All Plans): Regardless of plan type, funding allocated to a Capacity Building category like Improved Daily Living cannot be transferred or used for supports that fall under the Core Supports budget (e.g., paying for ongoing cleaning) or the Capital Supports budget (e.g., buying a wheelchair).   

### NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits (PAPL):
The NDIS sets rules around how much providers can charge for supports:

Price Limits: The NDIS publishes the Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits (PAPL) document, usually updated annually around July 1st. This document outlines the maximum price that registered NDIS providers can charge for specific support items, identified by unique line item codes. The accompanying NDIS Support Catalogue lists these items and their codes.   

Negotiation: Participants (especially if self-managed or plan-managed) and providers can negotiate a price lower than the official price limit. Unregistered providers are not bound by the price limits but must still adhere to principles of fair pricing.   

No Extra Charges: Registered providers are prohibited from charging more than the price limit for price-limited supports. They also cannot add extra fees, such as 'gap' payments, credit card surcharges, or booking fees, to the cost of NDIS supports.

For comprehensive information about current NDIS pricing, see our [NDIS Price Guide](/blog/ndis-price-guide/) and [NDIS Line Items Guide](/blog/ndis-line-items-guide-2024-25/) which provide detailed information about codes and pricing arrangements.   

Updates (e.g., 2024-25): Pricing arrangements are subject to change. For example, the 2024-25 updates included adjustments to price limits for supports delivered by Disability Support Workers (based on wage increases), the removal of the Temporary Transformation Payment (TTP) loading, continued price freezes for some therapy and coordination supports, and changes to cancellation policies. Staying informed about the current PAPL is essential. The dynamic nature of pricing reflects ongoing adjustments to market conditions, wage costs, and scheme sustainability efforts. However, price freezes in areas like therapy, despite rising operational costs, can create pressure on providers and potentially impact service availability or quality.   

### Therapist Travel Costs:
Providers delivering therapy under Improved Daily Living can charge for the time spent travelling to and from participant appointments, subject to specific rules:   

Claimable Time: The maximum travel time claimable each way depends on the participant's location, classified by the Modified Monash Model (MMM) zones:
- Up to 30 minutes each way in MMM zones 1-3 (major cities, inner/outer regional).
- Up to 60 minutes each way in MMM zones 4-5 (remote/very remote).   

Return Travel: Travel time from the participant's location back to the provider's usual place of work is only claimable if the participant was the last appointment of the day/trip and the provider is required to pay their worker for that return travel time. The maximum claimable return time is also capped at 30 minutes (MMM 1-3) or 60 minutes (MMM 4-5).   

Shared Travel: If a provider travels to see multiple participants in one trip, the total travel time can be reasonably divided (apportioned) among those participants. This arrangement must be agreed upon in advance within the service agreement.   

Billing: Travel charges must be billed separately from the therapy service itself using a specific "Provider Travel" line item code that corresponds to the main therapy code. The hourly rate for travel is typically the same as the therapy rate, unless a different rate is agreed upon beforehand.   

### Short Notice Cancellations:
The NDIS allows providers to charge a fee if a participant cancels an appointment without providing sufficient notice.   

Policy Change (July 2024): The notice period required to avoid a cancellation fee now differs based on the type of support.
- For supports delivered by disability support workers (often falling under the DSW Cost Model, primarily Core supports), the notice period remains 7 days.   
- For many other supports, including therapies funded under Improved Daily Living, the notice period has been shortened to 2 clear business days.   

Importance of Clarity: Participants should confirm the applicable cancellation policy with their specific providers, as outlined in their service agreements. The detailed rules around travel and cancellations reflect that these are significant cost factors managed by the NDIA. Transparency through clear service agreements is vital to prevent unexpected charges depleting plan funds.   

## NDIS Improved Daily Living Line Item Codes (Category 15)

The NDIS uses specific line item codes for billing. All Improved Daily Living codes start with "15" (Category 15). Here are the most common codes you'll see on invoices:

## Connecting the Dots: Improved Daily Living and Other NDIS Goals/Categories

Improved Daily Living supports do not exist in isolation; they are designed to work synergistically with other NDIS support categories and contribute to a participant's broader life goals. The skills and capacities developed through this funding often act as foundational elements that enable progress in other areas funded under the NDIS.

### Synergy with Other Capacity Building Categories:
Skills gained via Improved Daily Living can directly facilitate success in other Capacity Building domains:

Increased Social & Community Participation (Category 9 / CB Social Community): Enhanced communication skills from Speech Therapy, improved emotional regulation or confidence from Psychology/OT, or the ability to travel independently learned through Public Transport Training can all remove barriers to joining community groups, attending events, or building social connections. Developing skills to manage anxiety or sensory sensitivities (via OT/Psych) might be essential for some participants to comfortably engage in community settings.

For detailed information about social and community participation supports, see our [NDIS Social Community Participation Guide](/blog/ndis-social-community-participation-guide/).   

Finding & Keeping a Job (Category 10 / CB Employment): Many skills crucial for employment, such as time management, organisation, planning, problem-solving, communication, and managing the workplace impact of a disability, can be developed through therapies like OT, Psychology, or Speech Pathology funded under Improved Daily Living.   

Improved Learning (Category 12 / CB Lifelong Learning): Success in higher education or vocational training often relies on skills like focus, organisation, planning, effective communication, and coping strategies. Therapies funded by Improved Daily Living (OT, Psych, Speech) can help develop these, supporting participants to manage the demands of study. IDL funding might address disability-related barriers that the education system itself isn't responsible for.   

Improved Living Arrangements (Category 8 / CB Home Living): Maintaining stable accommodation often requires skills in budgeting, financial management, household organisation, planning, and potentially interacting with landlords or neighbours. These independent living skills can be directly targeted through OT, Social Work, or specific training under Improved Daily Living.   

Improved Health & Wellbeing (Category 11 / CB Health and Wellbeing): While this category funds specific health-related advice like exercise or diet plans, therapies under Improved Daily Living (e.g., OT, Psychology) can build the underlying skills needed to implement health routines, manage medications, or adhere to dietary plans. Dietetics and Exercise Physiology can also be funded under IDL when focused on building capacity for daily activities.   

Improved Relationships (Category 13 / CB Relationships): Developing positive relationships relies heavily on communication skills (addressed by Speech Therapy), emotional regulation and understanding social cues (addressed by Psychology, OT, Developmental Education), and conflict resolution strategies. These can all be funded through Improved Daily Living supports.   

Improved Life Choices (Category 14 / CB Choice and Control): This category primarily funds plan management and support coordination. However, the skills developed under Improved Daily Living, such as decision-making, planning, problem-solving, and self-advocacy, directly empower participants to exercise greater choice and control over their lives and their NDIS supports.   

The interconnectedness highlights Improved Daily Living as a pivotal category. It often addresses core functional skills, including physical, cognitive, emotional, and social. These serve as building blocks for achieving goals across nearly all other aspects of life reflected in the NDIS framework.   

### Relationship to Core Supports:
A key strategic aim of Capacity Building, including Improved Daily Living, is to increase independence and potentially reduce the long-term need for Core Supports. For example, if a participant uses Improved Daily Living funding to attend Occupational Therapy and learns effective strategies for meal preparation, they may subsequently need less funding in their Core budget for a support worker to assist with cooking. Similarly, learning to use public transport independently (IDL) reduces the need for funded transport assistance (Core). This potential to decrease reliance on direct assistance underscores the value of investing in skill development through Improved Daily Living, benefiting both the participant's autonomy and the scheme's long-term sustainability.   

## Tips for Success with Your Improved Daily Living Funding

To maximise the benefits of the Improved Daily Living (CB Daily Activity) budget, participants and their support networks should approach it strategically and proactively. Success often hinges on active engagement and informed decision-making.

Clearly Align Supports with NDIS Goals: The foundation of effective funding use is ensuring every chosen support directly links to one or more specific, measurable goals outlined in the participant's NDIS plan. Before engaging a therapist or trainer, articulate precisely how their service will contribute to achieving a particular goal (e.g., "Occupational therapy sessions will help me achieve my goal of preparing simple meals independently by teaching me safe knife skills and kitchen organisation strategies"). This clarity helps justify the funding and focus the intervention.   

Choose Qualified and Suitable Providers: Select therapists and trainers who are not only appropriately qualified and registered (e.g., check AHPRA registration for allied health professionals) but also have relevant experience working with the participant's specific disability and needs. It is reasonable to ask potential providers about their approach, evidence base, experience with similar participants, and expected outcomes. Finding a good fit is crucial for a productive therapeutic relationship.   

Understand Service Agreements: Before services commence, ensure a clear service agreement is in place. This document should detail the specific supports to be provided, the agreed costs (including hourly rates and any potential travel charges), the provider's cancellation policy, and how communication and progress will be managed. Understanding these terms upfront helps prevent misunderstandings and manage the budget effectively.   

Actively Track Progress: Capacity building is about achieving outcomes. Participants should work collaboratively with their providers to regularly monitor progress towards the agreed-upon goals. This information is vital not only for adjusting the support strategy if needed but also for demonstrating the value of the funding during NDIS plan reviews and reassessments. Continued funding for these supports in future plans may depend on showing evidence of progress and outcomes achieved.   

Utilise Support Coordination (if funded): If the NDIS plan includes funding for Support Coordination (under Improved Life Choices), the Support Coordinator can be an invaluable resource. They can help participants understand their Improved Daily Living budget, explore different therapy and training options, connect with suitable providers, navigate service agreements, and prepare for plan reviews.   

Leverage Flexibility (Especially in PACE Plans): For participants with newer PACE plans offering flexibility within the Improved Daily Living category, take the opportunity to explore the diverse range of eligible supports. Consider which combination of therapies or training might best suit learning style and goals. Don't feel limited to only one type of support if a blend might be more effective.   

Stay Informed with Official NDIS Resources: The NDIS landscape, including rules, pricing, and available supports, can evolve. Regularly consult official NDIS resources like the NDIS website, Our Guidelines, the current Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits (PAPL), and the Support Catalogue for the most accurate and up-to-date information.   

Ultimately, achieving success with Improved Daily Living funding is a collaborative effort. It requires the participant to be actively involved in setting goals, choosing supports, engaging in the learning process, and working with providers to track achievements. It is an investment in personal growth and independence, demanding active participation rather than passive receipt of services.

## Conclusion: Building Independence, One Skill at a Time

The NDIS Improved Daily Living (CB Daily Activity) support category represents a vital investment in the potential of participants. By funding a diverse range of therapies, assessments, and training programs, it provides targeted resources to build essential skills, enhance functional capacity, foster greater independence in everyday life, and enable more meaningful community participation. While navigating the terminology and rules can sometimes seem complex, understanding the core purpose of this Capacity Building support – distinct from the daily assistance provided by Core supports – is key to unlocking its benefits.

This category offers significant potential for positive change, empowering individuals to learn new ways of managing daily tasks, communicating effectively, regulating emotions, navigating their communities, and ultimately, exercising greater choice and control over their lives. The flexibility available, particularly within PACE plans, allows for highly personalised approaches, combining different supports to meet unique needs and aspirations.

Successfully leveraging Improved Daily Living funding requires active engagement. Participants, supported by their families, carers, and coordinators, play a crucial role in setting clear goals, selecting appropriate providers, understanding the terms of service, and monitoring progress. By strategically utilising the resources available within this category, NDIS participants can take significant steps towards achieving their goals, building lasting skills, and paving the way for a more independent and fulfilling future.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is CB daily activity in the NDIS?
CB Daily Activity is the NDIS portal's name for the Improved Daily Living support category (Category 15). The "CB" stands for Capacity Building. This funding pays for therapies, assessments, and training that help you develop skills for greater independence in daily life. You'll see "CB Daily Activity" when you log into your myplace portal, while your official plan documents refer to the same funding as "Improved Daily Living." Common supports include occupational therapy, psychology, physiotherapy, speech therapy, and life skills training.

### What are examples of CB daily activity NDIS supports?
CB Daily Activity (Improved Daily Living) funds a wide range of capacity-building supports, including:
- **Occupational Therapy** - daily living assessments, sensory strategies, home modifications advice
- **Psychology** - anxiety management, emotional regulation, coping strategies for disability
- **Speech Pathology** - communication skills, social cues training, swallowing assessments
- **Physiotherapy** - mobility improvement, strength training, balance work
- **Life skills training** - cooking, budgeting, time management, public transport training
- **Developmental education** - practical skill building for intellectual disabilities
- **Exercise physiology** - tailored fitness programs for functional improvement

### How much CB daily activity funding can I get?
CB Daily Activity funding varies based on your individual needs, goals, and circumstances. Typical annual ranges are: Low complexity ($5,000-$10,000), Moderate complexity ($10,000-$20,000), High complexity ($20,000-$40,000), and Very high complexity ($40,000+). Factors affecting your funding include the severity and complexity of your disability, the number of therapy types you need, your potential for skill development, your location (remote areas may receive more for travel costs), and your age (early intervention for children under 7 often receives higher allocations). Your funding is determined during your NDIS planning meeting based on evidence of your needs.

### What's the difference between Improved Daily Living and CB Daily Activity?
There is no difference. They're the same funding category, just referred to by different names in various NDIS documents. "Improved Daily Living Skills" typically appears in NDIS plans and the Support Catalogue, while "CB Daily Activity" is often used in the NDIS portal. The "CB" simply stands for "Capacity Building." This inconsistent terminology has caused confusion, but the NDIS PACE system aims to standardize the language. Regardless of which term you see, this funding supports therapies, training, and assessments designed to build skills and independence.

### Can I use Improved Daily Living funding for any therapy I want?
The flexibility depends on your NDIS plan type. With newer PACE plans, you generally have flexibility to use your Improved Daily Living funding for any therapy or training within this category that aligns with your plan goals. For example, you could divide funding between occupational therapy, psychology, and speech therapy based on your needs. However, older (non-PACE) plans might contain "stated supports" where funding is specifically allocated for a particular therapy (e.g., "$5,000 for psychology") and cannot be redirected to other therapies. In all cases, the therapy must relate to your disability needs and plan goals.

### What therapies and supports can be funded under Improved Daily Living?
Improved Daily Living can fund a wide range of therapies and supports including:
- Allied health therapies (Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Speech Pathology, Psychology, Exercise Physiology, Dietetics)
- Counseling and Social Work
- Specialized assessments
- Life skills training (cooking, budgeting, time management)
- Public transport training
- Driver training (if disability-related)
- Technology skills workshops
- Training for parents/carers to support skill development
- Art or music therapy
- Specialized early childhood intervention (for children under 7)
All supports must aim to increase independence and functional capacity related to your disability.

### What's the difference between Improved Daily Living and Assistance with Daily Life?
Though they sound similar, these categories serve different purposes:
- Improved Daily Living (Capacity Building): Funds therapies and training that teach you skills to become more independent (e.g., an occupational therapist teaching you strategies to shower independently)
- Assistance with Daily Life (Core): Funds someone to directly help you with daily tasks (e.g., a support worker physically assisting you with showering)
The key difference is building capacity versus providing direct assistance. Improved Daily Living focuses on long-term skill development through professional therapies and training, while Assistance with Daily Life provides immediate practical help through support workers.

### How do travel costs and cancellations work with therapists under Improved Daily Living?
For travel costs, therapists can charge for travel time to and from appointments, with limits based on your location: up to 30 minutes each way in major cities and regional areas (MMM zones 1-3) or up to 60 minutes each way in remote areas (MMM zones 4-5). Travel must be billed separately using specific "Provider Travel" codes. For cancellations, as of July 2024, you must provide 2 clear business days' notice to avoid cancellation fees for therapy appointments (reduced from the previous 7-day requirement). These details should be clearly outlined in your service agreement with each provider.

### What happens if I don't use all my Improved Daily Living funding?
Unlike some Core supports, Improved Daily Living funding doesn't automatically roll over to the next plan period. If you don't use it, you may risk having the amount reduced in your next plan if the NDIA sees consistent underspending. To avoid this, consider: reviewing your goals and whether the funded supports still align; discussing barriers to using the funding with your Support Coordinator or Local Area Coordinator; requesting alternate therapies that might better suit your needs; or adjusting appointment frequency to ensure you can use the full allocation effectively.

### How do I choose the right therapist for Improved Daily Living supports?
When selecting therapists, consider: their qualifications and registration status (e.g., AHPRA registration for allied health professionals); their experience with your specific disability type; their approach and the evidence base for their methods; how well they communicate and listen; practical factors like location, availability, and cancellation policies; and whether they offer in-home, clinic-based, or telehealth services to suit your preferences. Don't hesitate to request an initial consultation to assess compatibility, and ask your Support Coordinator (if you have one) for recommendations of therapists who have worked successfully with similar participants.
