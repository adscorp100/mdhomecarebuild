> "My siblings and I were tearing our hair out trying to understand my mum's home care options. We were getting conflicting advice and felt completely lost. We found an amazing navigator through MD Home Care, and it was like a weight was lifted. Our navigator laid out all the options, helped us choose a fantastic provider, and even reviewed the contract. We would have wasted so much time and money without her." - *David L., {suburb}*

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How is this different from a free advocacy service like OPAN?**
OPAN provides a crucial, government-funded service to uphold basic rights. The Navigation specialists you can find through MD Home Care offer private, professional consultancy for families who want a higher level of hands-on, expert support. They don't just advise; they can manage the entire process for you, from research and phone calls to provider negotiation and issue resolution.

**Are the navigators truly independent?**
The aged care navigation specialists in the MD Home Care network are independent consultants who provide fee-for-service consultancy. Their primary duty is to you, their client. Their goal is to use their industry expertise to get you the best possible outcome, regardless of which provider you ultimately choose.

**What are the fees?**
Most navigators offer an initial consultation for a fixed fee. From there, they can provide a tailored quote for a package of services based on your specific needs. Their goal is to provide exceptional value by saving you time, reducing your stress, and ensuring you get the most out of your loved one's funding.
