> "Before MD Home Care, we were struggling to understand my son's NDIS plan. His support network was disorganised, and we felt lost. Our Support Coordinator from MD Home Care changed everything. She listened, took control, and connected us with amazing local providers. For the first time, we feel confident about my son's future." - *Mary L., {suburb}*

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Who is eligible for Support Coordination?**
Support Coordination is available to NDIS participants who have funding for 'Capacity Building - Support Coordination' in their plan. If you're unsure whether you have this funding, we can help you check your plan during our free consultation.

**What is the difference between Support Coordination and Specialist Support Coordination?**
Support Coordination (Level 2) helps you understand and implement your plan. Specialist Support Coordination (Level 3) is a more intensive, clinical intervention for participants with very complex needs or who are in a crisis situation, requiring a higher level of expertise.

**What happens if I'm not happy with my support coordinator?**
Your satisfaction is our priority. We have a robust feedback process, and if for any reason you feel your coordinator is not the right fit, we will work with you to find a better match from within our team.

**Do you also provide other NDIS services? Is there a conflict of interest?**
Yes, MD Home Care is a registered provider for a range of NDIS supports. We manage this by ensuring our Support Coordinators act with complete independence. Their primary role is to connect you with the *best* provider for your needs, whether that's an MD Home Care service or another organisation. We offer you full choice and control, and our recommendations are always based on what's right for you, not us.

**How do you ensure the providers you recommend are high quality?**
Our reputation depends on the quality of our network. We have a strict vetting process for all providers we recommend in {suburb}, ensuring they meet all NDIS quality and safety standards and have a proven track record of delivering excellent service.
