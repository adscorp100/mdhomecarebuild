# Start a Rewarding Career as an NDIS Behaviour Support Practitioner

Are you passionate about making a real difference in people's lives? A career as a Behaviour Support Practitioner (BSP) is one of the most impactful and in-demand roles in the NDIS sector. But figuring out the right pathway—the qualifications, the NDIS requirements, and the practical skills you need to be successful—can be confusing.

## Don't Let Confusion Stop You From a Fulfilling Career

Choosing the right training is the most important first step. We hear the same worries from aspiring practitioners:

-   Worried about choosing a course that doesn't actually lead to a job?
-   Unsure if you will meet the complex NDIS Commission requirements for practitioners?
-   Concerned you'll learn theory but lack the practical, real-world skills to be confident in your role?

Find training providers who offer a clear, accredited path to becoming a job-ready practitioner in {suburb}.
