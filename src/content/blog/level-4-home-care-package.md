## Key Points

Level 4 Home Care Packages (HCP) are for Australians with high care needs, offering up to $62,013 annually.

Services include personal care, nursing, household tasks, and more, tailored to individual needs.

Qualification requires an assessment via the Single Assessment System, using the Integrated Assessment Tool.

The program will transition to the Support at Home program from July 1, 2025, with equivalent funding.

## What is a Level 4 Home Care Package?

A Level 4 Home Care Package is the highest level of support under Australia's current Home Care Packages Program, designed for older people with complex care needs. It helps them stay independent at home with services like personal care, nursing, and household assistance, funded at approximately $62,013 per year as of January 2025.

## How to Qualify

To qualify, you need an assessment through the Single Assessment System, which started in July 2024 and uses the Integrated Assessment Tool. Contact My Aged Care ([My Aged Care](https://www.myagedcare.gov.au/help-at-home/home-care-packages)) to arrange a visit, where an assessor determines if you need Level 4 based on your care needs.

## Funding and Costs

The government provides $62,013 annually for Level 4, but you might pay an income-tested care fee based on your finances. From July 1, 2025, the Support at Home program will replace this, maintaining similar funding levels initially.

## Surprising Detail: Upcoming Transition

It's surprising that the program will change to the Support at Home program in July 2025, potentially offering eight levels of support and up to $78,000 annually, affecting how care is delivered.

## Comprehensive Guide to Level 4 Home Care Packages in Australia

This detailed guide explores Level 4 Home Care Packages (HCP), the highest tier of government-funded support for older Australians with complex care needs, ensuring they can remain in their homes. We cover what these packages entail, qualification processes, funding details, and recent updates, including the transition to the new Support at Home program.

## Introduction to Home Care Packages

Home Care Packages are a cornerstone of Australia's aged care system, providing financial support for care services to help older people live independently at home. They are designed for those with care needs beyond what the Commonwealth Home Support Programme can offer, with four levels ranging from basic to high care needs. Level 4, the focus of this guide, is for individuals with the most complex requirements, such as daily assistance and advanced health support.

## Understanding Level 4 Home Care Packages

Level 4 Home Care Packages are tailored for individuals with high-level care needs, often requiring daily visits and support for multiple tasks. This level is ideal for those eligible for residential aged care but preferring to stay at home. The package offers flexibility, with services customized to the individual's needs, typically providing between 18.5 to 25 hours of support every fortnight, though this can vary by provider.

## Services Included

The services covered under a Level 4 HCP are extensive and include:

- **Personal Care:** Assistance with bathing, dressing, and grooming.
- **Nursing Care:** Complex nursing for conditions like dementia or Parkinson's, including medication management.
- **Household Tasks:** Help with cleaning, gardening, and other home maintenance to ensure a safe living environment.
- **Allied Health Services:** Access to physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and other specialists for mobility and health support.
- **Social Support:** Support for social activities and community engagement to maintain mental well-being.
- **Home Modifications:** Funding for safety improvements, such as installing ramps or grab bars.

These services are consumer-directed, meaning recipients can choose how to allocate funds in partnership with their provider, ensuring care aligns with their goals.

## Qualification Process

Qualifying for a Level 4 Home Care Package involves an assessment to determine care needs. Since July 1, 2024, the Single Assessment System has been in place, replacing previous assessment pathways like the Aged Care Assessment Teams (ACAT). This system uses the Integrated Assessment Tool to assess eligibility for government-funded aged care services, including HCPs.

## Steps to Apply

**Contact My Aged Care:** Start by calling 1800 200 422 or visiting the My Aged Care website ([My Aged Care](https://www.myagedcare.gov.au/help-at-home/home-care-packages)) to initiate the process.

**Assessment Visit:** An assessor, part of the Single Assessment System workforce, will visit you at home or in a hospital to evaluate your physical, psychological, medical, and social needs.

**Determination of Package Level:** Based on the assessment, you'll be assigned a package level, with Level 4 for those with high care needs, such as daily assistance and complex health conditions.

**Choosing a Provider:** Once approved, select a home care provider from the list available through My Aged Care's Find a Provider tool ([Find a Provider](https://www.myagedcare.gov.au/find-provider)).

Eligibility generally requires being 65 years or older (50 for Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people), though younger individuals with disabilities may also qualify. The assessment ensures the package level matches your needs, with Level 4 for those needing extensive support.

## Funding and Costs

As of January 1, 2025, the Australian Government subsidizes Level 4 Home Care Packages at approximately $62,013 per annum, paid directly to your chosen provider. This funding covers the services outlined in your care plan, but you may need to contribute through:

**Basic Daily Fee:** A standard fee, currently $13.08 per day for Level 4 as of January 2025.

**Income-Tested Care Fee:** Based on your income and assets, assessed via Services Australia/Centrelink, which reduces the government subsidy accordingly.

This funding structure ensures affordability, with the funds not affecting your pension as they aren't counted as income.

## Recent Updates and Future Changes

The Home Care Packages Program is undergoing significant reform, with the Support at Home program set to replace it from July 1, 2025. This new program, responding to the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, will:

- Bring together current in-home aged care programs, including Short-Term Restorative Care.
- Offer eight levels of ongoing tailored support, with indicative budgets up to $78,000 annually.
- Include pathways for restorative and end-of-life care, with extended restorative care from 8 to 12 weeks.
- Feature government-set price caps from July 1, 2026, and shorter wait times from assessment to support.

Until June 30, 2025, the current system remains, but recipients transitioning to Support at Home will have funding aligned to their existing package level, with no re-assessment needed unless care needs change. The Commonwealth Home Support Programme will transition no earlier than July 1, 2027.

## Tips for Maximizing Your Home Care Package

To make the most of your Level 4 HCP:

- **Select the Right Provider:** Look for providers with good reviews and experience in delivering complex care, using My Aged Care's Find a Provider tool ([Find a Provider](https://www.myagedcare.gov.au/find-provider)).
- **Plan Your Care:** Work with your provider to create a care plan that prioritizes essential services within your budget, reviewing it regularly as needs change.
- **Understand Your Budget:** Keep track of how funds are allocated, ensuring value for money, and consider carrying over unspent funds (up to $1,000 or 10% quarterly under Support at Home).
- **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Don't overlook provider fees or fail to review your plan annually, as needs can evolve, especially with conditions like dementia.

## Case Study: Hypothetical Example

Consider John, 78, with advanced Parkinson's and mobility issues, living alone. After an assessment via the Single Assessment System, he's assigned a Level 4 HCP with $62,013 annually. His provider offers daily nursing visits, home modifications like grab bars, and social support, allowing him to stay home comfortably, reducing family burden.

## Conclusion

Level 4 Home Care Packages are a lifeline for Australians with high care needs, offering comprehensive support to live independently. With funding at $62,013 annually and services tailored to individual needs, they ensure quality care at home. As the program transitions to Support at Home from July 2025, staying informed will help navigate changes.
