## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if Surgical House is right for my NDIS equipment needs?
Surgical House is well-suited for participants requiring comprehensive equipment solutions with professional support. They excel in complex mobility equipment, assistive technology, and situations requiring ongoing support and maintenance. Consider Surgical House if you need professional assessments, custom solutions, or prefer working with a large, established provider with national coverage. Their NDIS expertise makes them particularly valuable for participants navigating complex funding situations or requiring expensive equipment.

### What's the difference between buying from Surgical House versus other suppliers?
Surgical House offers specialized NDIS knowledge, comprehensive support services, and professional clinical expertise that smaller suppliers may not provide. They have dedicated NDIS teams, streamlined approval processes, and national service coverage. However, they may not always be the lowest-cost option for simple equipment. Their value lies in the comprehensive service package, professional assessments, installation support, and ongoing maintenance services rather than purely competitive pricing.

### How long does it typically take to get equipment through Surgical House via NDIS funding?
Timeframes vary significantly based on equipment complexity and funding pathways. Simple items from consumables budgets may be available within 1-2 weeks. Standard equipment requiring quotes typically takes 4-8 weeks from initial assessment to delivery. Complex or custom equipment can take 8-16 weeks or longer. Agency-managed participants often experience longer approval times than plan-managed participants. Surgical House can provide realistic timeframes based on specific equipment and funding situations.

### Can Surgical House help if my equipment breaks down or needs repairs?
Yes, Surgical House provides comprehensive maintenance and repair services for equipment they supply. They handle warranty claims, arrange repairs, and can provide loan equipment during service periods. They maintain service records and can coordinate with manufacturers for warranty work. For complex equipment, they often recommend maintenance contracts to ensure ongoing support. They also provide technical support over the phone and can arrange on-site service for complex installations.

### Do I need a prescription or assessment before ordering equipment from Surgical House?
Requirements depend on the equipment type and NDIS funding category. Simple consumable items may not require formal assessments, while complex assistive technology or mobility equipment typically needs professional recommendations. Surgical House can arrange assessments with their qualified staff if needed. For capital supports over $1,500, NDIS generally requires quotes and justification. They can guide you through documentation requirements and arrange necessary assessments as part of their service.

### How does Surgical House handle equipment trials before purchase?
Surgical House offers trial periods for many equipment types, particularly mobility aids and communication devices. Trial availability depends on equipment type, hygiene considerations, and availability. They typically arrange trials after initial assessment to ensure appropriate equipment selection. Trial periods usually last 1-4 weeks, allowing time to assess suitability in the participant's environment. Some trials may incur fees that can be offset against purchase costs. They'll coordinate with NDIS funding for trial arrangements where appropriate.
