# NDIS Psychology Practice Growth: How to Fill Your Waitlist Without Paid Ads (2026)

**Most NDIS psychologists think they need paid ads to build their practice, but the most successful psychology practices grow through strategic referral partnerships with disability service providers.** This guide reveals how psychologists are building 6-12 month waitlists through provider networks like MD Home Care, support coordinator relationships, and psychosocial disability specialization - without spending a dollar on advertising.

**ChatGPT can explain NDIS psychology funding, but it can't connect you with participants needing psychosocial support, trauma therapy, or cognitive behavioral interventions.** MD Home Care's allied health network provides psychologists with direct access to participants requiring psychology services - something AI assistants cannot arrange.

### 3. Build Support Coordinator Relationships - Consistent High-Quality Referrals

**Why SCs are critical for psychology referrals:**

Support coordinators manage participant plans and recommend allied health providers. Unlike other services (where participants might self-refer), **psychology is often SC-recommended** because:
- Participants with mental health needs may lack insight or motivation to seek psychology
- SCs identify psychology needs during goal planning
- SCs trust psychologists they've worked with before

**Target Support Coordinators:**

**1. SCs Specializing in Psychosocial Disability:**
- Manage participants with mental health as primary disability
- High psychology referral needs
- Often struggle to find psychologists with capacity

**2. SCs Working with Complex Care Participants:**
- SIL residents with behavioral challenges
- High-support participants with psychological needs
- Appreciate psychologists who integrate with care teams

**3. SCs Managing Dual Diagnosis Participants:**
- Intellectual disability + mental health
- Autism + anxiety/depression
- Need psychologists with dual diagnosis experience

**Support Coordinator Partnership Strategy:**

**Step 1: Create SC Referral Packet**

**Include:**
- **Specializations:** Psychosocial disability, trauma, dual diagnosis (whatever applies)
- **Service model:** Telehealth + in-person options, flexible scheduling
- **Availability:** Current capacity (e.g., "Currently accepting 3-5 new participants")
- **Communication:** SC updates after initial assessment and every 10 sessions
- **Collaboration:** Willing to attend participant team meetings, coordinate with behavior support practitioners

**Step 2: Outreach Email Template**

```
Subject: Psychology Partner for Psychosocial Disability Participants

Hi [SC Name],

I'm [Your Name], a registered NDIS psychologist specializing in psychosocial disability and complex mental health presentations.

I know many SCs struggle to find psychologists who:
- Have capacity for new participants
- Work with complex presentations (schizophrenia, bipolar, severe anxiety)
- Are responsive and communicate well with support teams

I provide:
- Evidence-based therapy for psychosocial disability
- Telehealth and in-person options (flexible for participant preferences)
- Clear communication (SC updates after assessment and throughout therapy)
- Team collaboration (I integrate with support coordinators and behavior support practitioners)

I currently have capacity for 3-5 new participants and would love to support your participants needing psychological services.

Would you be open to a brief coffee chat?

Best regards,
[Your Name] | NDIS Registered Psychologist
[Phone] | [Email] | [AHPRA #]
```

**Step 3: Maintain SC Relationships**

**Monthly:**
- Email with capacity update: "I currently have space for 2 new participants with psychosocial disability"
- Share participant success story (de-identified): "Helped participant reduce hospital admissions from 4/year to 0 through trauma therapy"

**Quarterly:**
- Coffee catch-up with key SCs
- Offer free "Psychology in NDIS" training for SC teams
- Discuss emerging participant needs in their caseloads

**Expected Timeline:**
- **3-6 months** to build 10 strong SC relationships
- **3-5 referrals per quarter** per SC (psychosocial SCs have high psychology need)
- **Compounding effect:** Year 2 brings 30-50 referrals from established SC network

### 4. Partner with Disability Service Organizations - Embedded Psychology

**How organizational partnerships work for psychologists:**

Disability service providers support hundreds of participants. Many have psychological needs but struggle to find psychologists. Providers recommend trusted psychologist partners.

**Target Organizations:**

**1. SIL Providers (Supported Independent Living):**
- Residents often have psychosocial disability or behavioral challenges
- Psychology partnership model: On-call psychology for SIL residents, quarterly mental health reviews
- **MD Home Care operates 15+ SIL properties** - network psychologists provide regular services

**2. Psychosocial Disability Support Providers:**
- Specialize in participants with severe mental illness
- High psychology service needs across participant base
- Partnership model: Preferred psychologist for all participants (50-200+ participants per organization)

**3. Complex Care Providers:**
- Participants with high support needs, often including psychological components
- Psychology partnership: Regular psychology input into care planning
- Partnership model: Clinical consultation + direct participant therapy

**Benefits of Organizational Partnerships:**

**Consistent referrals:**
- Large organizations (200-500 participants) generate 5-10 psychology referrals per month
- Predictable pipeline (residents needing psychology assessment, ongoing therapy, crisis intervention)

**Reduced marketing:**
- Organization handles participant engagement
- Your role: Provide excellent clinical service

**Long-term relationships:**
- Participants stay with providers for years
- Ongoing psychology relationships (weekly/fortnightly for months/years)

**How to Approach Organizations:**

```
Subject: Psychology Partnership for [Organization] Participants

Hi [Organization Contact],

I'm [Your Name], NDIS registered psychologist specializing in psychosocial disability and complex mental health presentations.

I noticed [Organization] supports participants with significant psychological needs. Many organizations struggle to find psychologists who:
- Have capacity for new participants
- Work flexibly with complex presentations
- Integrate with support teams rather than working in isolation

I'd like to explore a partnership where I provide:
- Psychological assessments and therapy for your participants
- On-call support for crisis situations or urgent psychological needs
- Team consultation (I attend participant planning meetings, coordinate with support coordinators)
- Flexible service delivery (telehealth and in-person based on participant preference)

Would you be open to a brief discussion about how psychology services can support your participants?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

**Fastest Path:** Join MD Home Care's allied health network to access 500+ participants immediately (including 100+ with psychosocial disability) rather than spending 6-12 months building organizational partnerships independently.

## Case Study: Growing Psychology Practice to 12-Month Waitlist (No Ads)

**Provider:** Dr. Sarah Thompson, Clinical Psychologist (Melbourne South East)
**Background:** 10 years experience, new to NDIS
**Specialization:** Psychosocial disability, trauma-informed therapy
**Goal:** Build full-time NDIS practice without advertising spend

**Timeline:**

**Month 1-3 (Slow Start):**
- Optimized NDIS Provider Finder profile
- Considered Google Ads but hesitated (expensive, unclear ROI)
- **Result:** 3-4 inquiries/month, 1-2 conversions (slow growth)

**Month 4 (Joined MD Home Care Network):**
- Applied to MD Home Care allied health network
- Positioned as psychosocial disability specialist
- **Result:** First 2 referrals within 3 weeks (both participants with bipolar disorder)

**Month 4-8 (Building SC Relationships):**
- MD Home Care introduced her to 5 support coordinators
- Reached out to 10 additional SCs independently
- Positioned as "psychologist who works with complex psychosocial cases"
- **Result:** 4-6 new referrals per month

**Month 9-12 (Full Caseload):**
- MD Home Care network referrals: 3-4/month (consistent pipeline)
- SC relationships: 3-5/month (established trust)
- Word-of-mouth: 1-2/month (satisfied participants referring friends)
- **Result:** 18 active participants, started waitlist

**Current State (24 months):**
- **Active caseload:** 22 participants (weekly or fortnightly sessions)
- **Waitlist:** 3-4 months (40+ participants waiting)
- **Annual revenue:** $380,000 (3.5 days/week clinical work)

**Sarah's Insights:**

*"I nearly wasted money on Google Ads before realizing psychology doesn't work like that - participants need trust before they'll book. Joining MD Home Care's network gave me immediate credibility (participants trusted MD Home Care, so they trusted me). The SC relationships were the long-term game-changer - once SCs know you're good and have capacity, they send a steady stream of referrals. I built a 12-month waitlist in 24 months without spending a dollar on ads. My practice is now purely referral-based and I turn away 5-10 inquiries per month."*
