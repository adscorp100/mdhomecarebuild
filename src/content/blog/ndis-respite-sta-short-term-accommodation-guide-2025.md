If you're navigating the NDIS, you've likely come across the term **STA**. It's a common type of support, but it can be confusing. What does it stand for, what does it include, and how is it different from respite care?

This guide provides simple, clear answers to help you understand what STA means for you or your loved one.

## What Does STA Stand For?

**STA** stands for **Short Term Accommodation**.

In the NDIS, STA is a support that allows you to live out of your home for a short period. It's a package that includes your accommodation, as well as the support you need for food, personal care, and activities.

## What is Included in STA Funding?

Think of STA as a bundled package. When you get funding for STA, it generally covers everything you need for your stay, including:

-   **Accommodation:** A place to stay, either by yourself or with other people.
-   **Personal Care:** Support with your daily personal activities.
-   **Food:** All your meals during your stay.
-   **Activities:** You and the provider can agree on what activities you will do.

The goal of STA is to give you a chance to try new things, develop new skills, and increase your independence, all while giving your informal support network (like your family) a break.

## Who is STA For?

STA is for NDIS participants who need a place to stay for a short time away from their usual home. It's often used as a form of **respite**. It can be a great option if:

-   Your usual carers are unavailable or need a break from their caring role.
-   You want to try new things, learn new skills, or make new friends.
-   You are transitioning to a more independent living arrangement and want to see what it's like.
-   There has been a breakdown in your usual support arrangements.

The NDIS usually funds up to **28 days of STA per year**. This can be used flexiblyâ€”for example, you might use it for one weekend a month or for a single 14-day block.

## How is STA Different from Respite Care or MTA?

This is a common point of confusion. Here's a simple way to look at it:

| Term | What It Is | Main Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **STA** | A **package** of supports including accommodation, food, and personal care for a short period (up to 28 days/year). | To provide a short break for you and your carers, and a chance to try new things. |
| **Respite** | The **reason** for the support. STA is a *type* of respite. You use STA to get respite. | To give your carers a break and support sustainable care arrangements. |
| **MTA** | **Medium Term Accommodation**. This is funding for accommodation for a longer period (up to 90 days). | To provide a place to live if you can't move into your permanent home because your disability supports aren't ready. |

In short: you use **STA** to get **respite**. **MTA** is for longer-term housing needs while you wait for your permanent home to be ready.

## How Can I Get STA in My NDIS Plan?

To get STA funded, you need to have a goal in your NDIS plan related to it. For example, your goal might be:

-   "I want to build my independence by trying a short stay away from my parents."
-   "I want to give my family a break so they can continue to support me."
-   "I want to make new friends by attending a weekend camp with a support worker."

You will need to discuss with your NDIS planner or LAC why STA is "reasonable and necessary" to help you achieve these goals.
