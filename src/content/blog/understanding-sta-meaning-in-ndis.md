## What Does STA Mean in NDIS?

**STA stands for Short-Term Accommodation.** It is a temporary housing and support service funded by the NDIS, designed to give both participants and their carers a break. It's a type of respite care that includes accommodation, personal care, meals, and activities for up to 14 days at a time.

This guide breaks down what STA is, who is eligible, how to get funding, and the key differences between STA and other NDIS supports.

### Key STA Facts (2025)

- **Purpose**: Provides respite for carers and a change of environment for participants.
- **Duration**: Funded for up to 14 consecutive days, with a typical annual allocation of 28 days.
- **Funding**: Comes from your NDIS Core Supports budget.
- **Inclusions**: Covers accommodation, food, personal care, and agreed-upon activities.
- **Providers**: Must be delivered by a registered NDIS provider.

## Who is Eligible for STA Funding?

To get STA funding in your NDIS plan, you need to show that it is a "reasonable and necessary" support that relates to your disability.

**Eligibility Checklist:**
1.  **It Helps You Meet Your Goals:** Your request for STA should align with the goals in your NDIS plan, such as building independence or increasing community participation.
2.  **It Offers Value for Money:** The NDIS will consider if STA is a cost-effective way to meet your needs compared to other supports.
3.  **It Supports Your Informal Network:** A primary reason for STA is to provide respite for your informal support network (family and carers) to help them sustain their caregiving role.
4.  **It's Not for Holidays:** STA cannot be used solely for a holiday. While you can engage in activities, the primary purpose must be disability-related (e.g., respite or skill-building).

## How to Get STA in Your NDIS Plan

Accessing STA funding involves a few key steps during your planning meeting or review.

1.  **Gather Evidence:** Collect reports from doctors, therapists, or support coordinators that explain why you need STA. This could include evidence of carer fatigue or the benefits of you spending time in a new environment.
2.  **Discuss Your Goals:** Clearly explain to your NDIS planner how STA will help you achieve your goals. For example, "STA will give my parents a break, allowing them to continue caring for me at home."
3.  **Request a Specific Amount:** While the NDIS makes the final decision, you can request a specific number of STA days based on your needs (e.g., "14 days per year to be used during school holidays").

## STA vs. MTA vs. SIL: What's the Difference?

## NDIS STA Rates 2025

These rates are all-inclusive, covering:

- Agreed-upon activities and outings.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the main purpose of STA?
The main purpose is twofold: to provide respite for informal carers to prevent burnout and to allow NDIS participants to have new experiences, develop new skills, and make new friends in a supported environment.

### Can I choose my own STA provider?
Yes, if you are plan-managed or self-managed, you have flexibility in choosing any registered NDIS STA provider. Agency-managed participants must use NDIA-approved providers.

### How is STA different from respite care?
STA is the NDIS term for what was often called "respite care" in older systems. The terms are often used interchangeably, but STA specifically refers to the NDIS-funded package that includes accommodation, support, and activities.

### Does STA funding cover travel costs?
No, the cost of travelling to and from the STA facility is not typically included in the STA rate. This is usually funded separately under your plan's transport budget.

### What should I bring to my STA stay?
Providers usually supply bedding and meals, but you should bring personal items like clothing, toiletries, and any required medications. It's always best to check with the provider beforehand.
