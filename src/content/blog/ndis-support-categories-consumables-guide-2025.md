## Frequently Asked Questions About NDIS Support Categories

### What are the main NDIS support categories?
The NDIS has 15 support categories organized into three budget types: Core Supports (daily assistance, transport, consumables, social participation), Capital Supports (assistive technology, home modifications, accommodation), and Capacity Building Supports (coordination, therapy, employment, education). Each category has specific rules about what supports can be funded.

### How much can I spend on NDIS consumables?
NDIS consumables have an annual limit of up to $15,000 for most participants. This covers disability-related items like continence products, wound care supplies, mobility aid accessories, and assistive technology consumables. Higher limits may be approved for participants with complex medical conditions or expensive specialized consumables needs.

### Can I transfer money between NDIS support categories?
You can transfer funds between categories within the same budget type, especially within Core Supports (categories 1-4). However, moving money between different budget types (Core, Capital, Capacity Building) typically requires plan manager approval or a plan review. Capital and Capacity Building supports often have more restrictions on fund transfers.

### What are Core Supports in NDIS?
Core Supports are the foundation of your NDIS plan, typically representing 60-70% of your budget. They include assistance with daily life, transport, consumables, and social participation. Core Supports have the most flexibility, allowing you to adjust how you use funding based on your changing needs throughout your plan period.

### What consumables does NDIS fund?
NDIS funds disability-related consumables including continence products, specialized wound care supplies, mobility aid accessories, communication device consumables, respiratory supplies, and personal care items specifically related to your disability. Items must be directly related to your disability and cost more than if you didn't have a disability.

### How do I know which support category to use for different services?
Each NDIS support has a specific category number and description in the Support Catalogue. Assistance with daily life covers personal care and household tasks, social participation covers community activities, therapy services go under improved health and wellbeing, and employment support falls under finding and keeping a job. Your provider should know the correct categories for their services.

### Can I change my NDIS support categories during my plan?
While you can't add entirely new support categories mid-plan, you have flexibility in how you use funding within existing categories, especially Core Supports. For significant changes or new categories, you'll need a plan review. Plan managers can help reallocate funding between similar categories within the same budget type.

### What happens if I don't use all my funding in a support category?
Unused funding in most categories doesn't roll over to your next plan, so it's important to use your allocation. However, you can often reallocate unused funds between categories within the same budget type during your plan period. Regular budget monitoring with your plan manager helps ensure you're maximizing your funding utilization.
