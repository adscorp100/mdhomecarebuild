### 1. Understanding Your Core Insurance Needs

We'll help you clarify exactly what you need based on your specific support role.

*   **Public Liability Insurance**: This is non-negotiable. It protects you if an accident happens, covering injury to a third party or damage to their property. Most independent workers in {suburb} need cover between $5 million and $20 million.
