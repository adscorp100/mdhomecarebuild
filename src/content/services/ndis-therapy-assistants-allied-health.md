## Frequently Asked Questions

**What's the difference between a Support Worker and a Therapy Assistant?**
A Therapy Assistant has specific qualifications (like a Cert III or IV in Allied Health Assistance) and works under the supervision of a qualified therapist to deliver a specific, goal-oriented therapy plan. A support worker provides more general assistance with daily living tasks.

**How do I know if the Therapy Assistant is qualified?**
We guarantee it. We provide full transparency on the qualifications and training of our team. Every assistant is supervised by a registered Allied Health Professional, ensuring quality and safety.

**How is this funded in my NDIS plan?**
Therapy Assistant services are typically funded from your **Capacity Building - Improved Daily Living** budget. We can help you understand your plan and how to best utilize your funds.
