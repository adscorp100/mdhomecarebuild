# NDIS PACE System 2026: Complete Guide to the New Participant Portal

## Key Points

- **All participants** are expected to have plans in PACE by May 2026
- **my NDIS portal** replaces the old myplace portal for participants in PACE
- **Flexible budgets** - plans are now organised by support categories rather than line-by-line items
- **my NDIS Contact** - a new NDIA staff member assigned to help with your plan queries

## What is NDIS PACE?

PACE (Provider and Participant Communication Environment) is the new computer system that the NDIS uses to manage participant plans, process claims, store information, and facilitate communication between participants and providers.

Think of PACE as a complete upgrade to the behind-the-scenes technology that runs the NDIS. While participants interact with the "my NDIS" portal on the front end, PACE is the engine running everything underneath.

### Why the NDIS Introduced PACE

The previous NDIS computer system (often called "the portal" or myplace) had limitations:

- Complicated user experience
- Limited flexibility in how funding was organised
- Outdated technology that was difficult to update
- Communication barriers between participants and the NDIA

PACE was designed to address these issues with:

- More user-friendly interfaces
- Greater flexibility in plan structures
- Modern technology that can evolve with the scheme
- Better communication tools and transparency

## PACE Rollout Timeline

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| PACE development begins | 2022 |
| Initial pilot with select participants | 2023 |
| Gradual rollout to more participants | 2024 |
| All participants expected in PACE | **May 2026** |

**When will you move to PACE?**

Most participants transition to PACE when their plan is due for renewal or they have a plan reassessment. The NDIA contacts participants before their transition with information about what to expect.

> **Already in PACE?** If your plan was recently renewed, you may already be using the new system. Check if you can access the "my NDIS" portal through myGov.

---

## The my NDIS Participant Portal

The my NDIS participant portal is the new online interface for participants whose plans are in PACE. It replaces the previous myplace portal.

### How to Access my NDIS Portal

**Through myGov:**
1. Go to [my.gov.au](https://my.gov.au)
2. Sign in with your existing myGov account (same as for Medicare, Centrelink, or ATO)
3. Link the NDIS service if you haven't already
4. Access your my NDIS portal

**Through the NDIS App:**
1. Download the updated NDIS app from the App Store or Google Play
2. Sign in with your myGov credentials
3. Access your plan information on the go

### What You Can Do in my NDIS Portal

| **Check plan details** | View your goals, funded supports, and plan dates |
| **See all claims** | Track every claim made against your plan |

## Key Changes Under PACE

### 1. Flexible Budget Categories

One of the biggest changes under PACE is how your plan funding is structured.

**Old System (myplace):**
- Funding allocated to specific line items
- Limited flexibility to move money between supports
- Many separate budget categories to track

**New System (PACE):**
- Funding organised by broader support categories
- More flexibility within each category
- Fewer restrictions on how you use funding (as long as it meets NDIS rules)

| PACE Support Category | What It Covers |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Daily Living** | Personal care, household tasks, meal preparation |
| **Social & Community** | Community access, social activities, recreation |
| **Lifelong Learning** | Skill development, education support, training |
| **Work** | Employment support, job coaching, workplace assistance |
| **Relationships** | Support to build and maintain relationships |
| **Health & Wellbeing** | Allied health, therapy, exercise physiology |
| **Home** | Housing support, home modifications |
| **Safety, Independence & Choice** | Support coordination, plan management |

### 2. My Providers Feature

"My Providers" is a new feature that lets you:

- **Record preferred providers** in your plan
- **Control what information** providers can see about your plan
- **Manage provider access** through the portal

**Important:** If you have agency-managed funding for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA), Home & Living supports, or Behaviour Supports, you **must** record your providers in my NDIS.

### 3. Privacy Controls

PACE gives you more control over your information:

- Choose which providers can see your plan details
- Control access to your budget information
- Decide what goals and supports are visible to each provider
- Revoke access at any time

### 4. My NDIS Contact

Every participant in PACE is assigned a "my NDIS Contact" - an NDIA staff member who:

- Helps with administrative tasks
- Answers plan queries
- Assists with communication
- Supports you to navigate the system

**Note:** Your my NDIS Contact is not the same as a Support Coordinator. Support Coordinators are funded through your plan and help you find and connect with providers. Your my NDIS Contact is an NDIA employee who handles administrative matters.

---

## What Stays the Same

While PACE introduces many changes, some things remain constant:

- **Choice and control** - You still choose your own providers and how to use your funding
- **NDIS principles** - Supports must still be reasonable and necessary
- **Plan reviews** - You can still request a plan review if your circumstances change
- **Support categories** - Core, Capacity Building, and Capital supports still exist
- **Management types** - Self-managed, plan-managed, and NDIA-managed options remain

---

## PACE for Different Plan Management Types

### Self-Managed Participants

If you self-manage your NDIS plan, PACE gives you:

- Direct access to make claims through my NDIS portal
- Real-time visibility of your budget and spending
- Easier tracking of provider payments
- More flexibility in how you use your funding

### Plan-Managed Participants

If you use a plan manager, PACE means:

- Your plan manager will transition to the new claiming system
- You can see all claims your plan manager submits
- Better transparency over your budget usage
- Communication between you, your plan manager, and the NDIA improves

### NDIA-Managed Participants

If the NDIA manages your plan:

- Your providers will claim directly to the NDIA through PACE
- You can track all claims made against your plan
- You can endorse "my providers" for faster claims processing
- Your my NDIS Contact helps with any funding queries

## Common Questions About PACE

### Will I lose my current funding when I move to PACE?

No. Your funded supports and total plan budget carry over to PACE. The way funding is displayed and categorised may look different, but your overall funding should remain the same.

### Do I need to do anything to move to PACE?

The NDIA will contact you before your plan moves to PACE. In most cases, the transition happens automatically at your next plan renewal. You'll receive instructions on how to access the new my NDIS portal.

### Can I still use myplace if my plan is in PACE?

No. Once your plan is in PACE, you'll use the new my NDIS portal. The myplace portal won't show your current plan information.

### What if I don't want to move to PACE?

PACE is the new system for all NDIS participants. You cannot opt out of the transition. However, you can get help from your my NDIS Contact, Support Coordinator, or Local Area Coordinator if you need assistance using the new system.

### Will my providers be affected?

Yes, providers also use PACE for claiming and communication. Most providers have already transitioned or are transitioning to the new system. This shouldn't affect your services, but you may notice changes in how providers record supports or communicate with the NDIA.

### How do I add a provider to my plan in PACE?

1. Log into the my NDIS portal
2. Go to the "My Providers" section
3. Search for your provider by name or ABN
4. Select the provider and confirm

### What if I have trouble accessing my NDIS portal?

Contact the NDIS National Call Centre on **1800 800 110**. Your my NDIS Contact can also help you set up access or troubleshoot issues.
