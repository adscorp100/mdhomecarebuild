A Level 3 Home Care Package provides **$40,945.70** in annual government funding to help older Australians with intermediate care needs live independently at home. But what does that mean in practical terms?

This guide answers the most pressing questions about the Level 3 package. We'll break down the funding, explain how many hours of care it provides, detail the services you can access, and help you navigate the critical decision of choosing a provider.

## What is a Level 3 Home Care Package?

> **Unsure Which Level You Need?** Take our free [ACAT Assessment Level Quiz](/tools/acat-level-quiz) to estimate which Home Care Package level suits your care needs.

A Level 3 Home Care Package (HCP) is designed for older Australians who need a medium level of support to continue living safely and comfortably in their own homes. It's a step up from basic support (Level 2) and is intended for those with more complex needs that require coordinated services.

## How Much Funding Do I Get in 2025?

As of the latest government figures for 2025, a Level 3 Home Care Package provides **$40,945.70** per year.

This amount is paid directly to your chosen Home Care Provider, who then works with you to spend the funds on the services outlined in your care plan.

## How Many Hours of Care Is That?

The annual funding translates to approximately **10-13 hours of care per week**.

However, this is not a fixed number. The exact hours you receive will depend on several factors, most importantly the fees charged by your provider. Providers with lower administration and management fees will leave more of your subsidy available for direct care hours.

## What Can I Use My Funding For?

Your Level 3 package is flexible and can be used for a wide range of services to support your independence. Here are some of the most common examples:

### Personal Care
- Assistance with bathing, dressing, and grooming
- Help with toileting and continence management
- Mobility support for moving around the home

### Health & Wellbeing Support
- Nursing care (e.g., medication management, wound care)
- Allied health services (e.g., physiotherapy, occupational therapy, podiatry)
- Transport to and from medical appointments

### Home & Household Help
- Cleaning, laundry, and other domestic assistance
- Meal preparation and nutrition support
- Minor home maintenance and modifications (e.g., installing grab rails)
- Light gardening

## Self-Managed vs. Provider-Managed: The Pros and Cons

One of the most important decisions you'll make is whether to self-manage your package or use a traditional provider's fully managed service.

| Feature | Self-Managed | Provider-Managed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fees** | Lower (more funds for care) | Higher (less funds for care) |
| **Control** | Full control over funds & staff | Provider manages funds & staff |
| **Flexibility** | Choose any support worker | Limited to provider's staff |
| **Responsibility**| You handle all admin & coordination | Provider handles all admin |

**The bottom line:** Self-managing offers lower fees and greater control, but requires you to take on the administrative work. A traditional provider offers convenience at a higher cost.

## How to Choose the Best Provider: A Checklist

Finding a quality provider is crucial. Here are key questions to ask when you are interviewing potential providers:

- **Experience:** How long have you been providing Level 3 packages?
- **Services:** What specific services do you offer and can you tailor them to my needs?
- **Staffing:** What are the qualifications and training of your care workers?
- **Fees:** Can you provide a complete, transparent breakdown of all your fees (administration, management, exit fees)?
- **Communication:** Who will be my primary point of contact and how will we stay in touch?
- **Flexibility:** How do you handle changes in my care needs or requests for different support workers?

## What a Level 3 Package Looks Like in Real Life

Hearing from others can help you understand the real-world impact. Anonymized stories from forums and government case studies show:
- A gentleman with early-onset Alzheimer's uses his package to get the support he needs to stay at home with his wife.
- A woman named Margaret uses her funding for help with daily tasks, transport, and social activities, which has greatly improved her quality of life and independence.
- Another user was able to hire a consistent support worker who not only helps with household chores but also provides valuable emotional support.

The common theme is that while the system can be hard to navigate, a Level 3 package can be life-changing, enabling independence and providing peace of mind for families.

## The Future: The New Support at Home Program

The Australian Government is introducing a new **Support at Home program** which will replace Home Care Packages from **November 1, 2025**.

The goal is to create a simpler, more flexible system. While details are still being finalized, it's expected that existing Level 3 recipients will transition to the new program and receive at least the same level of funding. We will update this guide as more information becomes available.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the difference between a Level 2 and Level 3 package?
A Level 2 package is for low-level care needs (approx. 3-5 hours/week), while a Level 3 package is for intermediate needs (approx. 10-13 hours/week) and provides a significantly higher subsidy.

**Not sure if you qualify for aged care or NDIS?** Take our free **[HCP vs NDIS Comparison Quiz](/tools/hcp-vs-ndis)** to find out which program suits your situation.

### What if my Level 3 funding is not enough?
If your care needs increase, you can request a reassessment from My Aged Care to be considered for a Level 4 package. It's also worth reviewing your provider's fees, as switching to a provider with lower fees can free up more of your funding for care.

### How long is the waiting list for a Level 3 package?
Waiting times can vary significantly. According to the My Aged Care website, the expected wait for a Level 3 package is currently 3-6 months.
