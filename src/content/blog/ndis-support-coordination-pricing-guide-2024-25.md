## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between the three levels of Support Coordination?
The three levels differ in complexity, focus, and required expertise: Level 1 (Support Connection) is basic assistance at $65.09/hour, helping participants understand their plans and connect with providers. It's typically short-term and focuses on building capacity to self-manage. Level 2 (Coordination of Supports) at $108.48/hour is more comprehensive, helping with negotiating services, resolving issues, and building complex support networks. It's commonly funded for participants with moderate support needs or multiple providers. Level 3 (Specialist Support Coordination) at $195.27/hour is the most intensive, designed for high-risk situations requiring specialized expertise. It involves navigating complex systems (health, justice, housing) and often managing crises. This level requires coordinators with professional qualifications in allied health, disability, or developmental education.

### How many hours of Support Coordination can I get in my NDIS plan?
The NDIS doesn't have fixed formulas for Support Coordination hours. Allocations are individualized based on your complexity of need, goals, informal supports, and other factors. Typical amounts range from 20-100 hours annually (averaging 1-8 hours monthly), with more complex situations receiving greater funding. Support Coordination is typically most intensive when you first join the NDIS or experience significant life changes. As you develop skills and establish stable supports, hours may decrease in subsequent plans. To maximize your allocation, clearly articulate during planning meetings how Support Coordination helps you implement your plan and achieve goals. If your circumstances change mid-plan (like a housing crisis or loss of informal supports), you can request a plan review for additional hours.

### Can Support Coordinators charge for travel time or report writing?
Yes, Support Coordinators can charge for both travel time and non-face-to-face activities like report writing from your Support Coordination budget. For travel, they can claim up to 30 minutes each way in metropolitan/regional areas (MMM 1-3) or 60 minutes each way in rural/remote areas (MMM 4-5) when traveling to meet you in person. These travel costs use the same hourly rate as the coordination service itself. For non-face-to-face activities (report writing, research, phone calls, emails), these are billable at the standard hourly rate when directly related to coordinating your supports. Good Support Coordinators typically discuss how they bill for these activities upfront in their service agreement, including approximate time allocations to help you budget effectively. Some coordinators might offer videoconferencing options to eliminate travel costs.

### Is the price of Support Coordination negotiable, or are the rates fixed?
The prices listed in the NDIS Price Guide are maximum amounts that registered providers can charge, not fixed rates. There is room for negotiation, particularly if you're self-managing your plan. Many providers charge the maximum rates, especially since Support Coordination pricing has been frozen since 2020 despite rising operational costs. However, some providers may offer discounted rates in certain circumstances—for example, if you're committing to a substantial number of hours, if services can be delivered remotely (saving travel time), or if you're part of a group of participants living together. When negotiating, consider value rather than just price—an experienced coordinator who charges maximum rates but helps you access better services and fully utilize your plan may deliver better outcomes than a cheaper but less effective option.

### Can Support Coordination be delivered remotely or must it be face-to-face?
Support Coordination can be delivered through a mix of in-person and remote options, including video calls, phone consultations, and emails, without any difference in the hourly rate. The 2024-25 pricing arrangements explicitly recognize these flexible delivery methods. The most effective approach typically combines both: in-person meetings for building relationships, complex problem-solving, and observing your home environment, with remote options for regular check-ins, quick questions, and administrative tasks. During COVID-19, the NDIS confirmed Support Coordination could be fully remote when necessary. The best arrangement depends on your preferences, technical capabilities, support needs, and location. Some participants, particularly those with communication barriers or complex needs, benefit more from face-to-face support, while others prefer the convenience of remote services.

### What qualifications must an NDIS Support Coordinator have?
The NDIS doesn't mandate specific qualifications for Level 1 and 2 Support Coordination, though providers must register with the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission and comply with the Practice Standards. For Level 3 (Specialist Support Coordination), coordinators typically need professional qualifications in relevant fields like disability services, developmental education, social work, occupational therapy, or psychology. Beyond formal qualifications, effective coordinators should have: strong understanding of the NDIS and broader support systems, excellent interpersonal and advocacy skills, problem-solving abilities, knowledge of local support options, cultural competence, and skills in trauma-informed approaches. When choosing a coordinator, consider asking about their specific expertise with your disability type, cultural background, or particular challenges (like housing or justice system involvement).

### How does Support Coordination pricing differ from general Support Worker rates?
Support Coordination is generally higher-priced than standard support worker services due to the specialized skills and responsibilities involved. While standard support workers under the NDIS might be billed at $59.81-$64.36 per hour (2024-25 rates), Support Coordination ranges from $65.09-$195.27 depending on the level. This price difference reflects the coordinator's role in complex service navigation, negotiation, crisis management, and building sustainable support systems—activities requiring different expertise than direct support work. Unlike many support worker services, Support Coordination prices don't include weekend or evening loadings in the base rate (though providers can apply percentage loadings for after-hours services). Support Coordination focuses primarily on capacity building rather than direct support delivery, making it a different type of service with its own pricing structure.
